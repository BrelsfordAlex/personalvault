# Vent

[[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] emailed me at like 4pm today saying this ![vent 12-11-24.png](/img/user/Personal/Images/vent%2012-11-24.png)
and it sent me in a panic because I didn't do anything today at home while [[Personal/Places/AT work\|AT work]] but soon as I got that email I was sent into a fucking panic attack because of it, what if it was like when I was a kid and I got in trouble?
cause if i i get in trouble then my partner time could be taken away and if its taken away ill be alone every day and ill spiral and depression and and i i then people would leave me and my [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] could scream at me and and try to scare me and and ground me and make sure i never see anyone ever again till he he sees fit...
and and im then a wont get partner time and I just 

im numb... im tired im just I was crying earlier but I- im just numb now...  the anxiety is there but I can't...

[[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] reassured me it would all be ok and im hoping they are right...
