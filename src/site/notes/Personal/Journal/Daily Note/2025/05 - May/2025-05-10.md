### What Happened Today?
#### Triggers 

#### Journal Entry
Today was really productive and I am so proud of myself. I let my self sleep in till about *11am* and woke up to the tv playing ==Wallace and Grommit== and I finished that movie before getting out of bed and letting myself just wake up, got lunch ordered and then when [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] and [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] came home I cleaned our room and started laundry and listened when my body said stop! Our desk is clean too and I- I let myself be smaller and relaxed because [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Rend]] said it was ok... 

is it weird i just i want to be weak around him? I don't know...
