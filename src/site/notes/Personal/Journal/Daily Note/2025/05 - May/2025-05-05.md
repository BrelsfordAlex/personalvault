#### Journal Entry
today wasn't the best day honestly, I had my final art class, which went ok! here is the art pieces I did for my final
The first one is titled =="Butterfly Effect"==  Using the metaphor of the butterfly in the back ground showing different memories that lead the main person to be here
![Butterfly Effect - 05-05-2025.png](/img/user/Personal/Images/Butterfly%20Effect%20-%2005-05-2025.png)

This one is called =="What has been broken cannot be repaired"== and it is themed based off of one of the circles in the above art. Overall I am so proud of it! I really love how I did the ladder and the cracks in the window.

[[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] called me at **11pm** saying they got #death-threats over the phone and I am logically why would someone call them about a discord server but also there is a possibility it wasn't a dream... I don't know... did I make the right call? I... my gut says it was a dream but also if it wasn't and something happens I would hate myself forever... I... I hope I made the right call making them call the cops...

if it was a dream i made them waste police resources on this but I- I don't know...

I I don't know... I don't know... 

they keep changing it up, it was a text then a call then a text I... I am starting to not believe them but I- 

better safe than sorry right?

My art professor said something today, *"When in doubt scribble it out"* and god does that sound tempting right now... I 

please let it have been a dream... please 

I can't sit in that call I can't I 

fuck I need to take my meds that will help, I'm having a lot of anxiety right now... Today has been real fucking shit I swear to fuck...
