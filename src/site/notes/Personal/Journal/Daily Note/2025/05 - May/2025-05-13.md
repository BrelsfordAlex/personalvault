#### Triggers 
- [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] yelling at [[Personal/People/Courtney\|Courtney]] for pressing her Emergency Button to shut a neighbor up  
- Woke up screaming 
	- <span style="background:#40a9ff">Dream - </span>Having my past animals like *Simba*, *Shadow*, *Heidi*, *Peanut*, *Chance* all dying around me and I kept trying to scream but I couldn't. No one cared that they kept dying around me...
#### Journal Entry 
Today I used the Quick Add plugin, it really helped me stay present and not forget most of the day. I want the expectation for myself that I would only do it when I remembered but still it helped me so much. I only got really out of it 2 times which i feel so glad about. 

I am so happy today, I feel really productive. I worked really hard at work, Listened to my body and took a nap when I needed to, and even just relaxing before I do work. I am just so proud of myself all of this is so new but it really helped me. 

That dream really fucked me up... More than I think I realize. Having my past animals dying in my arms in the dream really fucks someone up...

At work [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] had showed me a cover for a report he was doing for a client and the lawyer and I took that and edited that cover and made one that looked more KB Accounting and he - he said he was proud of me for it and I... It doesn't feel good coming from him. Why doesn't it feel good? It should... but i why doesn't it feel good? It's not fair. I am so mad that it doesn't feel good... It should but I guess since I haven't heard it at all from him unless he was yelling at me and gaslighting me puts me on edge cause I am expecting that part from him. I am expecting him to start telling me "I have always told everyone I was proud of you" and really anything from the fight we had on [[Personal/Journal/Daily Note/2025/01 - January/2025-01-23\|2025-01-23]] but it never came... so I am #nervous for that show to drop if it ever does... I hate this I hate living here. it makes me so nervous and #unsteady with being here... 

I don't know... I just don't know...
