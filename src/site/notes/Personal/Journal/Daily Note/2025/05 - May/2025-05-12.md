### What Happened Today?
#### Journal Entry
Today I was productive... I did have a bit of an #ocd episode at work helping my mom organize her files, but i ate good food and even ordered myself a smart watch!  I honestly am so lucky to be dating [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] they were so good to me and helped me...

when i was being sexual with [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] I ended up going past my limit and ending up shaking and crying and cold, i was so scared and i just couldnt stop crying... but Marra was so nice and just called me and kept calling me a good  pretty boy and that i did so good and i i dont know how - swear shes a wizard but she she helped me calm down and i i fell asleep in a call with her...

i i love them so much i do however have a headache idk why
