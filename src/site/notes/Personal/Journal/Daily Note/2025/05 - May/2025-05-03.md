# Welcome to the Vault

This is the vault for all of our personal things — things like our [[College/Capstone/Capstone-Home\|Capstone]], [[Personal/Personal-Home\|Personal Journal]], and maybe more in the future.  

Use this space when you need to, or when you can. Nothing here is urgent. Nothing here is mandatory. 

Do you have a good thing that happened? Put it in [[Essentials/Achievements\|Achievements]]

Were you triggered? put it in [[Essentials/Triggers\|Triggers]]

# Are You New Here?

Hi. If you're reading this, you're doing a good job just by showing up.

This page is for when you're tired, foggy, confused, anxious, or just not sure what to do next.  
You don’t have to do everything. One small thing is enough.

---

## 1-Minute Check-In
- [ ] Who is fronting right now?
- [ ] Do you feel tired, foggy, or not real?
- [ ] Is there anything you need?

---

## Gentle Next Steps
Pick just *one* if it feels okay:
- [ ] Open a **Daily Log** and write one sentence
- [ ] Leave a quick note in [[Communication\|Communication]]
- [ ] Try one thing from [[What Helps\|What Helps]] and write your trigger in [[Essentials/Triggers\|Triggers]]
- [ ] Look at [[Essentials/Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]]
- [ ] Visit [[Essentials/Plans/Crisis Plan\|Crisis Plan]] (only if needed)

---

## If You Don’t Know What to Do

That’s okay.
- You can rest here.
- You can read.
- You can close the vault and come back later.

This is a safe space. You don’t need to be productive to belong here.

---

## Notes to Self (or from Others)
- “You’ve survived every hard moment so far.”
- “It’s okay to go slow.”
- “Your safety matters more than your schedule.”

---

# Internal Guidelines

These are soft agreements we’ve made to care for ourselves and each other. They’re not punishments — they’re support.

- If triggered, please use the [[Essentials/Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]] first before acting.
- Write your trigger in [[Essentials/Triggers\|Triggers]]

---

> [!important]+ **System Rules: Fronting**
> These are rules our system has agreed on to help us stay safe, accountable, and respectful — to ourselves and to others.
>
> **1) System Accountability**  
> We take responsibility for actions while fronting.  
> Society will still treat us as one person, so we don’t blame another part as a way to avoid consequences.
>
> **2) The Body Must Be Taken Care Of**  
> - Eat something. Drink water. Sleep when you can.  
> - If you want a snack, put it on the list — we’ll try to get it.  
> - Please limit fast food to 2x/week — we’re trying to lose weight.
>
> **3) Who Can Front**  
> - Anyone can front, unless they pose a danger to the body, other alters, or others.  
> - If that happens, fronting privileges can be revoked without warning.
>
> **4) Age-Based Fronting Limits**  
> - Alters under 13 must co-front with someone 18+ for safety and masking.  
> - Exceptions: Fay, Ally, Sparkle, Redacted.
>
> **5) Interactions with Others**  
> - You don’t have to interact with anyone you don’t want to.  
> - If you want friends who know we are a system, you must introduce yourself — don’t assume people know who you are.

# Today
---
**Who was front:** Unsure I know [[Personal/Parts/Lily\|Lily]] was here
**Any Time Loss:** ehh? 
	**If so When:** all day
**Emotions Felt Today:** #sick #stomach-pain #anxiety #tired/exausted #stomach-bug
**What happened Today:**
Honestly I went to bed at *3:00 am* and woke up at *4:30 am* with massive back, stomach and chest pain. I woke [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] up cause I was in tears from how bad it hurt. I had a #fever and was very Clammy. Which honestly? Sucks really fucking bad. I spent a couple of hours pacing around trying to figure out why my stomach felt tight (Like if you pressed on it, it was enlarged and really tight) and eventually(with the help of some Icy hot) I threw up all of my dinner from Yesterday. That made the pain go away but I still couldnt sleep. I sat in #discord and tried to sleep while [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] and [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] took turns taking care of me. That in of it self was really hard but I let them because, I would want them to wake me if I needed it. 

Eventually I thought that a bath and fell asleep in the tub. The warmth helped a lot so I grabbed my heating pad and sat downstairs using it on full fucking blast on my back which made me feel so much better. When I went upstairs I asked [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] to just sit with me... I really didn't want to be alone... and I was exausted... They sat with me and I fell asleep on call with them and it just felt like they were taking care of me which felt so nice...

When I woke up me and them talked alot which felt nice too and I threw up some more...  After we dropped oput of the call I slept till like *5:30pm* and woke up feeling a little better but I just i didn't want to be alone I wanted cuddles and someone to take care of me and I asked [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] to just sit with me and they are on call with me while I write this...

I love them so much [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] and [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] both I love with all my fucking heart... I this is the first time I've actually woken them up needed support and help and they both jumped at the gun and were there immediatly which felt so nice that they both were there trying their best and [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] tried so hard and I know they didn't know what to do but they still sat with me till I fell asleep even a little bit and I I fuck they are trying and it feels so nice it feels so so nice to just feel so taken care of while I'm probably dealing with #weed-withdrawls being so stressed im sick, and tired....

I I love them so much and I I can see they are trying so hard and I love them I love them I love them
