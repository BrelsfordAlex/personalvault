## Lily & Shadow – Processing the Hurt

### Voices in System: Lily 🫧 + Shadow 🕷️  
**Context:** Processing medical neglect, emotional hurt, and grief around our parents' choices. The fact that [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] and [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] even if they thought they were doing right, by them not telling us we were Autistic, had OCD and even our medical issues we were deprived of the supports that we really needed... Their excuse of "Becauser then you (me) wouldnt use it as a crutch" isnt good enough... 

---

### Dialogue Reflection

**Lily:**  
> But what if they meant well?  
> It hurts. It's not fair… Why did my sister’s ADHD get support, and not me?  
> Why did my OCD or autism never get diagnosed?  
> Why was I the one who got left out?  
> I don’t want to hate them, I’m just so hurt.  
> Shadow, it’s not fair.  
> They couldn’t have known though…  
> I feel like I deserve it…

**Shadow:**  
> Even if they didn’t mean to hurt us—they still did.  
> I hate them for it. I’m so mad.  
> They said they wanted us to have a “normal life”—but what about everything we had to *unlearn* because of that?  
> That wasn’t kindness. That was neglect.  
> Think about the compulsions. The fear. The pain.  
> The leg pain they ignored as “just growing pains”? Now our legs give out.  
> We told them, and they didn’t listen.  
> Lily, that was medical neglect.  
> If we have epilepsy and they missed it—I’ll never forgive them.  
> They helped [[Personal/People/Courtney\|Courtney]] more. Even then, she was failed too.  
> They were never the parents we needed.  
> They gave us an eating disorder. They told us we were neurotypical until it was too late.  
> And now you realize… you can't keep making excuses for them.

### Emotional Summary

- **[[Personal/Parts/Lily\|Lily]]** is grieving. She’s confused, conflicted, and hurting. There’s guilt about being angry. There's a deep longing for care, safety, and fairness.
- **[[Personal/Parts/Shadow\|Shadow]]** is furious. Protective. Calling out the harm for what it is. Recognizing the neglect, naming it. Refusing to minimize it any longer.
- There is pain between hope and anger. Love and betrayal. Longing and loss.

### Reflections

- ❓ *Why is it easier to believe I deserved it, than to admit I was failed?*
	-  Because then maybe I will feel like it will all be ok
- ❓ *Would I treat a child the way I was treated? If not—why do I accept it for myself?*
	-  because I...what if i deserve it...
- ❓ *Is love real if it ignores my pain?*
	- no....
- ❓ *What does it mean to stop making excuses—for them, and for myself?*
	- it means its real, and i don't want it to be real
# Journal Reflection – {{date}}

### How am I feeling this morning?
_Describe honestly—even if it's messy._

**Tags:**  
#tired #exhausted #scared #numb

---

### Did I hear from them? How did it make me feel?
- [x] Yes  
- [ ] No

**What was said:**

**[[Court (Partner)\|Court (Partner)]]**  
> “Baby we don't hate each other, you aren’t gonna lose us... sometimes I just get angry when they haven’t cared about themselves because I care about them so much... I am really sorry it triggers you. We aren’t leaving and nothing is falling apart...  
> Would us being muted in a call work? Because 99% of the time I can't freely call at home...  
> I wish I could just sit and watch movies with you...  
> I know you're scared about the epilepsy... I will make sure you know exactly how loved and cared for you are (which is lots)...  
> You are not a burden or a bother... I just ask that you remember you’re not the only one stuck or feeling isolated...  
> As for sleep... I’ve seen you online most nights from like 1am to 4am... putting your phone down might be something you need to try from now on.”

**[[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]]**  
> “Oh my love… we don’t hate each other. We promise we love you so, so, so much... I’m sorry we haven’t made you feel seen.  
> Movie night soon?  
> I love you ❤️  
> Typed by Honour, for Viv, who is currently dial-up toning at the Christopher Lee facts Court’s been giving us. Am good to tism call through the week as well.”

**How it made me feel:**  
It felt so nice to know I’m not alone… I know I hurt them, but what they said felt so genuine.  
I really see it now.  
I didn’t know I’d been staying up that late—*that* scared me.  
But now I have a plan. Court and I came up with a sleep idea—I'm going to start a podcast at **8:30pm** and get into bed at **9:30pm**.  
Once I find something that works, we work on the next step.  
I’m not alone in this. I’m *not alone*.

---

### Do I still believe I deserved to speak up?
Yes.  
Because I learned that I was feeling, not just thinking.  
I’ve been trying to sleep wrong—trying to sleep like a neurotypical, not like someone autistic.  
My parents didn’t tell me I was autistic—and that kept me from getting the supports I needed.  
That wasn’t my fault.  
And now, I’m finally learning how to take care of myself.

I’m going to try listening to the podcast at **8:30pm** and get in bed at **9:30pm**. This is the first step. I am allowed to take it

---

### What I’m Holding Right Now

- I’m holding grief, and I’m finally letting myself call it grief.
- I’m holding pain from feeling overlooked, unseen, unsupported.
- I’m holding [[Personal/Parts/Shadow\|Shadow]]’s anger and [[Personal/Parts/Lily\|Lily]]’s sadness—and both are valid.

---

### What I Need

- Space to feel angry without guilt.  
- Reassurance that I didn’t deserve this.  
- Someone to say: *“You were not too much. You were not broken. You were failed by people who should have known better.”*  

---

### One Truth I’m Claiming
> It wasn’t fair.  
> It wasn’t okay.  
> And I didn’t deserve it.

### What small thing did I do to care for myself today?
_Even if it was just breathing through a hard moment._

---

### One thing I need to hear right now:
_Even if I don’t believe it yet._

> _Example: “I’m not too much. I’m allowed to want love.”_

It will all be ok...

---

### What am I proud of myself for today?
_Big or small. For surviving. For reaching out. For not using. For trying._

---

### One gentle step I can take tomorrow:
_Something soft: a message, a nap, a glass of water, or just permission to rest._

Going to bed when my alarms to go to bed go off
