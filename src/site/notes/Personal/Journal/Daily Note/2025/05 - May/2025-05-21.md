Journal:
Today felt like shit... I feel like i i was so alone this entire week i idk

Tonight, I shared something really heavy with them. It’s been building for a long time, and I finally said it—not to hurt anyone, but because I care deeply.  
I’m scared. I’m tired. And I feel like I’m fading in the background of something I love.

Hearing about their fight triggered something in me. It made me feel helpless, like I could lose them at any moment. Like I’d leave the room and come back, and one of them would be gone. I’ve already lost too much. I can’t go through that again.

I tried to tell them I love them. That I’m here. But I’m also hurting. I feel like I’m on the outside looking in—like it’s *them together*... and then *me*. I want to feel chosen, held, reassured. I want someone to want a date night with me, or movie night, or just... time that feels like *love*, not just support.

I’m not asking for money or gifts. I just want time, affection, and to know that I matter too.

I think what hurts the most is feeling like I give so much, and I get so little back sometimes. I know they care. I know they’re struggling too. But I feel so alone. And it’s hard not to feel like I’m annoying, or a burden, or too much. Even though I know they don’t see me that way... I still *feel* it.

And now, on top of it all, I’m scared about my health. I might have epilepsy. I’m terrified of being an adult. I spend most days dissociating. I haven’t slept well in weeks. I’m trying to help them, trying to love them, trying to keep myself steady—but I’m so tired.

Most days, no one checks in. No one tells me I’m loved, not without me asking or reaching first. I crave that. I crave someone seeing me and saying, “You matter. You’re not just the extra.”

I sent the message. I told them the truth. And now I’m sitting with the weight of it, scared I overstepped.

But maybe… maybe it’s okay that I said it. Maybe it’s okay that I *need* things, too.

After sending it, all I could feel was fear. Not relief, not peace—just that heavy, clawing worry that I made things worse. That they’ll think I’m ungrateful, dramatic, too much. That they’re already dealing with so much and I just added another weight to their backs.

But at the same time… I know I wasn’t cruel. I didn’t lash out. I didn’t accuse or blame. I just spoke from a place of fear and longing. I asked to be seen. I asked to feel loved in the way I *need*, not just in the way they know how to give. That’s not wrong.

Still, it hurts. Everything feels sharp right now.  
I want to be held. I want to feel wanted.  
I want to fall asleep next to someone who *knows* how scared I am and stays anyway.

I’ve been trying to quit using weed because I know it numbs things too much. I know I’ve been leaning on it to escape, and I’m trying not to. But right now, my brain is screaming for it—not because I want to get high, but because I want *quiet.* I want the noise in my head to stop.

I haven’t been sleeping. I’m drained down to the bones. Every part of me feels like it’s fraying—and yet, I still want to be good for them. I still want to love well, even when I feel like I’m falling apart.

Part of me wants them to reach out first. To say, “You’re not too much.” To say, “We heard you. We love you.”  
I’m scared they won’t.  
I’m scared they’ll be distant or tired or too overwhelmed to respond, and I’ll spiral even more.

But I’m also trying to remember:  
I told the truth.  
I’m still here.  
And even if nothing changes overnight… that still means something.

Maybe tomorrow I’ll feel a little lighter. Or maybe I’ll just survive again. And that’s okay too.
