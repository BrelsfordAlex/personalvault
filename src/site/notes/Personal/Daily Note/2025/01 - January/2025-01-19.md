Well no TikTok today and it feels so empty like the world just doesn't exist anymore it's so scary to feel this alone ... My mind keeps trying to find something to fill the void..... I'm also just so sleepy deprived I don't even know anymore I also think I started my fucking period which is LOVELY....  Court says they are getting me out of the USA.... That sounds so nice .... 

I just I want cuddles.... I dont have energy to cook but I need food for DND.... I I don't know what to do ðŸ˜­ 

I might ask court their opinion cause I just yeah 

I'm not ok I'm really not.... There's a new alter in the system [[Personal/System/Grumbot\|Grumbot]]

I kinda think he's cute but he also keeps making sure I sleep which is annoying ...

Idk

I guess I'm also not ok cause I'm  i wanna help armoury but Court keeps stoping because I  I'm not ok and I shouldn't try to help everyone when I'm not ok 

Which makes sense! It does but doesn't mean I don't hate it 

I  i  idk 

I guess TikTok is back up .... 
How should I feel about this I.... Don't I don't know 

Yeah I started which is fucking GREAT. I don't care if I could get internal bleeding I just  took pain killers

i know they had that mental break and i i dont fully understand but i... thye didnt check on me after I said i need someone they didnt message when they woke up they didnt do anything 

that hurt 

its all about them its all **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** **ALL ABOUT FUCKING THEM ITS ALL ABOUT THEM** 

THEY DONT FUCKING CARE WHY WOULD THEY FUCKING CARE

i no this is bpd this is bpd

i took an edible to relax i am trying to just relax i 
i should sleep....


**[[Personal/System/Grumbot\|Grumbot]]:** Sleep is needed, 
**[[Personal/System/Lily\|Lily]]:** but...
**[[Personal/System/Grumbot\|Grumbot]]:** Sleep is required.
**[[Personal/System/Lily\|Lily]]:** ok...

 i don't know. I... I honestly don't know. I don't know.
I... I don't know, man. It's difficult. Because of the fact that I... How do I word this? I apparently have been going through a dissociative break for most of my life.
I don't know what that means. Not fully, anyway. I don't know how to process it.
I just thought everyone lived like we're all sims. Like we all just are puppets or cogs in the machine. We're not real.
But apparently that's just a dissociative break. And I mean, I remember at one point in my life it felt like my brain just kind of snapped like a twig. Which, thinking about it, that should have clued me in.
But it didn't. I don't know what to do about this. Hell, I am terrified right now of the world.
Everything with TikTok just proved that if the United States wanted to, they could theoretically cut everyone off from the rest of the world. If they so wanted to. Which is scary.
That is so fucking scary. I also too, I just, I heard my childhood wasn't okay. And since last time I wrote, I came to realize something.
I realized that my childhood wasn't okay. I have memories that I got back that make me feel dirty. I don't know how to feel about that.
I also, I, my [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]]'s been a trigger [[Personal/Places/AT work\|AT work]]. We all know this. I say we.
Me and my therapist know this. And with her recommendation I sent my [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] a, or wrote my [[Personal/People/Mom\|Mom]] a message as not only her child but as one of her employees that just, I recognize this. And I'm trying to do everything I can to kind of work through it.
And I didn't want anything to change. I was just hoping for sympathy. But her message to me felt cold.
And I've also been working on this really cool fucking art. And my parents have been cold to me. And when I showed my parents the art, they acted like they didn't care.
Which hurts. And I realize they've treated me like that my entire life with things that I liked. But if I show Jen, Court, Armory, anything I do, they show that they like it.
And that feels so nice. I can't wait to be able to hug them. I can't.
Because I think I really need it. I really do. I just want a break.
From all of it. And I've been having hallucinations apparently. Audible ones, like my phone going off but there's no messages.
Hearing people talk. Sometimes I've even seen faces. For a split second in the corner of my vision.
That doesn't feel okay. That feels scary. Very scary.
I don't know. I might finish this and just head to bed. You know?
