**Who was front:** [[Personal/System/Lily\|Lily]]
**Any Time Loss:** Honestly not sure... maybe?
**Emotions Felt Today:** #happy #productive #overwhelmed #overstimulated #tired/exausted #Hungry
## **What happened Today:**
Today I felt so productive not only did I work on my art homework that honestly *not even sure was due at all but just in case glad its done* but also I worked on my #dndoneshot that im doing on the 21st for courts birthday. I am just so happy with it so far... I did get overwhelmed with learning about statblocks but I did make one of my own!! I'm so proud of myself!!!!!!

I also cleaned up a little bit and made my bed and I took a shower and shaved and even flossed!!! I feel so productive with myself today.. .I will say right now i feel really dizzy and like my vision is tiling which is making it hard to see and focus...

i know I said [[Personal/Daily Note/2025/02 - February/2025-02-08\|2025-02-08]] that I would explain me and [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]]'s fight... I just  im just gonna copy paste what i vented to [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]] and [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] about cause im really lazy and i can't **fully** remember what happened...

> [!note]
> This happened on [[2025-01-23\|2025-01-23]] so any references to time are in scale to that

> I mentioned how  I can't scan and he said like last week *(relative to when it happened last week)*  he's been working on it and so he comes in today to fix it and I was just logging into a work email and entering a code so he was just leaving as I was pressing enter with saying "cool just let me know when your good" in his tone and so I said "I'm just entering this code then your good to go" a bit defensive but yeah. He stares at me like "ok" silence so I'm like "do you want it" "please" so I'm like cool I hand over my PC to him and he's like "I don't know what I did to you I'm just trying to help" and I got full defensive like "I was just communicating with you I'm sorry". And he didn't like that so he snapped at me so I went full just dissociate and numb and eventually he's like "I don't know why you hate me I don't know what I did to you to make you feel like this towards me I've been nothing but a good father trying my best" so I just respond in my best soft deer voice "never said you weren't"
> 
> then at like **7pm ish** i got called downstairs for a family meeting to "sort me and dads relationship" and i made the stupid choice of being honest and telling him how i feel and he snapped and said "well none of that is true get it out of your fucking head we never yelled at you you didnt have a bad childhood 
> i got yelled at for saying "sir" when i have memories of him telling me to call him that and he swears he never did and the conversation grew into him telling me everything I remember from my childhood wasn't real and now I don't know what's real or what isn't,  and hes also like "yes this is how you feel but facts are facts and facts speak over feelings" anytime stuff like this happens he ends it with two things he wans me to remember that are true 1) that he helped deliver me and that i was one of the happiest moments in his life and 2) hes told everyone hes ever worked with how happy and proud of me he is
> if i get defensive he yells and snaps at me until i act docile...i i mentioned how when ive shown them something ive done and tey dont sound interested that never happened
> he he said "i dont know where down the line you got this idea that we hit you and fucking abused you but get it out of your head"
> he said "ive told everyone ive ever worked with how proud of you i am"
> but hes never told me that except after hes mentally broken me
> i got in trouble today for not making conversation with them in the beginning of it and when i pointed out that ive tried and ive gotten nothing towards the end hes like "its not you its me"
> he he also wanted me to tell him what i thought about my childhood and him and mom  and when i said "im not comfy with that" he immediatly went to "well i think you think im abusive"
> i know better than to say what i really thought...
> the part that hurts me is he wants me to act like i do around you two jen and k  (my just "friends")  around him and mom...
> my dad wanted to meet my therapist to "set things straight"
> and  said i wasnt comfy with that and he lost it


So yeah thats what happened...
I just since then I have felt.... scared to even frown around my family i want to create indepenance and seperation but i don't even know if that will happen anymore...  like my parents are acting like nothing happened and i not gonna lie the gaslighting **REALLY** got to me ~~still is somewhat~~ but thanks to my therapist i am trying to write in a notebook everyday something good ive done to just keep be grounded and remind me of the babysteps ive taken.... which is nice

Like ive set up a goal of if i floss and brush my teeth 7 days before bed this week (started on Thursday the 6th) I will use my entire paycheck on the 14th for myself. No bills nothing .... and then going forward im buying stuff for my trip and planning it out on things i 100% want to do... 
```
```
babysteps...

 its the babysteps that feel hard because i feel like i havnt made any progress but i just look at that journal right before bed and I just see even small achievments like getting out of bed all the way to everything i did today and it reminds me this time last year I wouldn't have done any of that....

if i was faced with the same situation a year ago I would have just sunken into depression and ive been fighting it and ive been doing #selfcare and im just so proud of myself...

while it might feel like 20 steps back im still so much further along than i was a year ago and I have my therapist [[Court(Partner)]] and [[Armore (Partner)]] to thank for that...

I also decided that either during the trip or after im gonna apply at the **University of Aberdeen** to get a teaching certificate so I can teach abroad... this will allow me to just get space away from my parents and closer to those i love....

if i like the trip and it goes well...
```
```
not gonna like the shit with the government right now is scary though...  i hope my passport is still acceptable....


god I am ticcing so much... i think this is my brain's sign that I should go to bed..... before 3 am...

i am going to brush my teeth...

**OH YEAH I ALSO MADE FOOD TODAY!!!!**

![buffalo Chicken Dip 1-9-25.png](/img/user/Personal/Images/buffalo%20Chicken%20Dip%201-9-25.png)

It was Buffalo chicken dip with carrots in ranch and i i ate the full plate and i  im tempted to go heat up some more of the dip before bed.... im just hungry...

i should listen to my body... water isnt making it so im not hungry....

if i don't i will slip back into my #eatingdisorder which honestly ive gone the past 3 days without eating much.... so i should listen to my body....

yeah im going to eat some of the carrots.... maybe heat up the dip i don't know but i shouldnt sleep hungry... 

i'm gonna go do that **AFTER** i make the todo list for tomorrow
