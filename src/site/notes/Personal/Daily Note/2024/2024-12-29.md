# Vent

I'm doing really bad rn. I can't sleep withouf having a nightmare if I'm not microdosing an edible, the nightmares are awful and the type I wake up in a panic. They have only gotten worse but that's been going on for like a month or 3 now. I'm really fucking unstable and I've been pushing it down to help Armore cause Dec is their bad month and I want to help them and when they are more stable I'll let myself be unstable. I'm just I don't have energy to do anything I'm scared of my capstone Found out last night that unless I took another class I wouldn't get my loan and cause of that I took a 100 lvl drawing class cause I need that money for the trip Speaking of the trip the flight ticket money saving is going horribly and I am giving up ordering a business class ticket and just getting prem economy this week The system communication is nothing and it's awful we are always blurry and unsure of who we are or even if we are a we anymore. [[Personal/System/Lily\|Lily]] has been front stuck for almost a full year and it's making her just even more unstable cause she can't even leave. She's stuck. The organization and order in the system was dismantled cause it just wasn't working so we're letting things happen naturally of how like system order happens Christmas I felt just no joy all I got that mattered was a suitcase set but the rest was clothes while my sister got shoes and make up and I just I've never felt heard or seen on Christmas and it hurts.... But court and [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] got me something and that at least makes me happy cause I feel atleast somewhat seen.... I've been forcing myself to stay awake in case Armore needs me.... Cause of the month but I'm also just I can't anymore it hasn't stopped them having really bad months it hasn't stopped since May and I'm so drained and exhausted of it I don't have any emotions to helping them anymore.... I'm just empathetically shot I yeah I'm not ok....I feel so unloved in my home with my family

And i I haven't even told court or Armore that my parents have been fighting a little bit for past couple of weeks and that's a bad trigger for me and just lately I have felt out of place in my own home I always feel like this but it's so worse.... They don't hear me they don't see me and worst of all my [[Personal/People/Dad\|Dad]] working at my job has started to trigger me BADLY cause he he holds power over me and it makes me feel just like I need to defend myself and I get angry and I can't handle that. On a scale from 1 to 10 I'm a solid -25.....

But I keep pushing it down so I can help Armore

And ignoring it and ignoring it cause they need me and I can't say I can't rn cause they need me cause they are really not ok and I need to help them when they need me and so I keep saying soon as they are more stable I'm not fighting it anymore... But it feels like that will never come. And at some points during the night I've just.... I've hit the self harm level of unstable where I've thought about it sometimes but I don't....

  And at some points during the night I've just.... I've hit the self harm level of unstable where I've thought about it sometimes but I don't....

I feel like I'm being crushed under rocks and it feels like no one sees the rocks...Fuck I've been nonverbal for awhile now but I keep forcing myself to talk for my partners! I also dec is a bad time for me too... It's the month of my grams birthday and the month my cat died....But I can't let myself feel that cause Armore needs me ...And I haven't lost any weight so I've been starving myself again and I.... I'm not ok

Honestly I don't know anymore. I tried to tell [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]] that I needed me time but they just kept calling kept going and going and I just I couldnt handle people being around me right now.  This weekend and into next couple of days are just hard for me cause it is when [[Personal/People/Heidi\|Heidi]] died in my arms and it feels like [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore]] doesnt even care that im not ok!  like they havnt checked on me once all they care about is needing people around and that fucking hurts 

why can't they just ask simply "Are you ok?" then I would feel like they care about me, ya know?
