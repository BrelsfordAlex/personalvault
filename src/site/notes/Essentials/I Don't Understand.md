# **"****What's going on? Where am I?****"**  
  
It's okay! You may not know what's happening right away, or even your name or who you are.  
You are in a **system**. A system is a collection of identities living in one body.  
  
# **"How does this happen?"**  
  
This is caused by early childhood trauma. The personality splits into **multiple** to cope with the trauma. These separate identities are called **alters**. You are one of these alters. If you feel uncomfortable or "not right" in your body, that's okay and normal. Unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do about your current body, but there are ways to make yourself feel more comfortable like wigs, make-up, clothing, and ect.!Medically, this is called **DID** (Dissociative Identity Disorder) or **OSDD** (Other Specified Dissociative Disorders).  
  
# **"Where am I?"**  
  
You are on a planet called Earth! The year is 2024. You can find the exact time and date (https://time.is/) .  
  
# **"I remember things that didn't happen to this body. Is that normal?"**  
  
Yes! Although these memories didn't happen in the real world, they may feel real to you. That's okay and valid! Click here for more information on this.  
  
# **"I'm hearing voices in my head. Should I listen to them?"**  
  
These might be other alters, so yes! You can ask them for help if you need it. If these voices are saying bad things, try to distract yourself.

# I can't breath what do i do?

# How to tell you are in a triggered State
- Do you feel suddenly tired, like you need a nap?
- Do you feel “out of it,” like the world is moving but you’re not?
- Do you feel not real or disconnected from your body?
- Do you feel foggy or blank?
- Is it hard to focus or stay present?
T*here are so many more questions but please visit [[Essentials/I Don't Understand\|I Don't Understand]] which might help too*
