# Post-Crisis Plan

You got through it. That matters. This plan is here to help us rest, recover, and re-center.

---

## 1. Check In Gently
- [ ] Who is fronting now?
- [ ] How does your body feel?
- [ ] Are you tired, hungry, cold, or overstimulated?

---

## 2. Basic Needs First
- [ ] Drink water
- [ ] Eat something gentle
- [ ] Go to the bathroom
- [ ] Sit or lie somewhere soft and safe

---

## 3. Re-Orient to Safety
- [ ] Say out loud: *“I’m safe now. That moment is over.”*
- [ ] Look around the room. Name:
  - 3 things you see  
  - 2 things you can touch  
  - 1 thing you can hear
- [ ] Open [[Essentials/Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]] if needed

---

## 4. Comfort + Self-Kindness
Pick 1–3 things that feel okay:
- [ ] Change into soft clothes
- [ ] Wrap in a blanket
- [ ] Watch something familiar (a comfort show or YouTube)
- [ ] Play a calming video game
- [ ] Light a candle or turn off overhead lights
- [ ] Put on calming music or rest in silence
- [ ] Use a fidget or sensory object

---

## 5. Optional: Journal or Reflect
- [ ] Add a line to the daily log
- [ ] Leave a message in [[Personal/Communication\|Communication]]
- [ ] Was there anything we learned or want to remember?
- [ ] Do any parts want to share how they feel?

---

## 6. Rest is Not Optional
- [ ] Consider a nap, quiet time, or low-stimulus activity
- [ ] No “shoulds” for the rest of the day — just *okayness*

---

## Reminder
You do not have to bounce back fast. Your safety matters more than productivity. You are allowed to just be.
