# Vault User Guide

Welcome to the vault. This space exists to support us — not pressure us.

It’s here to help with memory, communication, self-care, and healing. We don’t have to use everything. We can add, skip, or change anything that doesn’t feel right.

---

## Where to Start

- If you're okay and want to check in → open a daily note In the journal folder
- Need help? → go to [[Plans/Crisis Plan\|Crisis Plan]]

## Gentle Rules

- You can write as much or as little as you want
- You’re allowed to just read
- Nothing here is mandatory
- One sentence is enough
- No one will be mad if you skip a day, a log, or a plan

---

## Navigation Tips

- Use the **Backlinks** (bottom of notes) to see where notes connect
- Use the **Tag Pane** if you want to find `#low-energy` or `#todo` items
- You can search any part’s name using `[[Name]]` if they’ve made a profile

---

## If You’re Not Sure What to Do

Try one of these:
- Say hi in [[Communication\|Communication]]
- Fill out one line in a daily journal (pinned at top)
- Add one thing that helped to [[What Helps\|What Helps]]
- Look at [[Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]] and try one
- Just scroll through pages and see what feels safe

---

## You Are Allowed To...

- Rest
- Not remember
- Come back later
- Just be here
- Change things

This vault is for **us**, not a to-do list. You’re doing okay just by being here.
