## Notes to Self (or from Others)
- “You’ve survived every hard moment so far.”
- “It’s okay to go slow.”
- “Your safety matters more than your schedule.”

> # Internal Guidelines

> These are soft agreements we’ve made to care for ourselves and each other. They’re not punishments — they’re support.
> 
> - If triggered, please use the [[Essentials/Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]] first before acting.
> - Write your trigger in [[Essentials/Triggers\|Triggers]]

> > [!important]+ **System Rules: Fronting**
> > These are rules our system has agreed on to help us stay safe, accountable, and respectful — to ourselves and to others.
> >
> > **1) System Accountability**  
> > We take responsibility for actions while fronting.  
> > Society will still treat us as one person, so we don’t blame another part as a way to avoid consequences.
> >
> > **2) The Body Must Be Taken Care Of**  
> > - Eat something. Drink water. Sleep when you can.  
> > - If you want a snack, put it on the list — we’ll try to get it.  
> > - Please limit fast food to 2x/week — we’re trying to lose weight.
> >
> > **3) Who Can Front**  
> > - Anyone can front, unless they pose a danger to the body, other alters, or others.  
> > - If that happens, fronting privileges can be revoked without warning.
> >
> > **4) Age-Based Fronting Limits**  
> > - Alters under 13 must co-front with someone 18+ for safety and masking.  
> > - Exceptions: Fay, Ally, Sparkle, Redacted.
> >
> > **5) Interactions with Others**  
> > - You don’t have to interact with anyone you don’t want to.  
> > - If you want friends who know we are a system, you must introduce yourself — don’t assume people know who you are.

# ❤️ Closing Note

This vault belongs to all of us. It doesn’t need to be perfect. You’re allowed to take up space here, even on days when you don’t know who you are.
