**Who was front:** [[System/Lily\|Lily]]

	**If so When:**
**Emotions Felt Today:** #tired #happy  #anxiety 
**What happened Today:** Today was ok, When i got to work i was busy but I got a memory I didn't like...

**the Memory**
	Growing up whenever it was spagetti night my parents [[People/Mom\|Mom]] [[People/Dad\|Dad]] would have me and my sister shirtless cause we were messy kids and we would then have bath night and that just... feels wrong to me but I don't know how to really feel about it... should that make me feel sick? Honestly whenever I think about it I just get...  i just feel dirty in a way  if that makes sense? Like and ontop of that my [[People/Dad\|Dad]] talks constantly about my birth and all of that just doesnt feel ok with me.... it might just be me though #traumaTriggered 
**At work**
	At work today i did alot! I even ate breakfast and lunch!!!! im so proud of myself!!!
**At Home**
	When I got home I just needed self care and ended up playing Pokemon Emerald to many types for a while and it felt nice...
	I then made food and honestly it wasnt bad!!!
	chicken with Dijon mustard maple syrup and Vidalia onion sauce and zucchini onion and sweet potatos
