Court says that taking care of myself with eating sleeping, self care stuff will help and that i cant force it... 
that is just hard though i want it to be better now...  but i can't force it to be better...

I decided to do a dnd campaign and im going to do that 2/21/25 on the dnd world im working on (Arenthia) and im so excited to do it but also scared... I dont know if i can't do it... but i want to try...
