## Thursday 1/23 
---
**During Work** I mention I can't scan and he said like last week he's been working on it and so he comes in today to fix it and I was just logging into a work email and entering a code so he was just leaving as I was pressing enter with saying "cool just let me know when your good" in his tone and so I said "I'm just entering this code then your good to go" a bit defensive but yeah. He stares at me like "ok" silence so I'm like "do you want it" "please" so I'm like cool I hand over my PC to him and he's like "I don't know what I did to you I'm just trying to help" and I got full defensive like "I was just communicating with you I'm sorry". And he didn't like that so he snapped at me so I went full just dissociate and numb and eventually he's like "I don't know why you hate me I don't know what I did to you to make you feel like this towards me I've been nothing but a good father trying my best" so I just respond in my best soft deer voice "never said you weren't." AFTER TELLING ME HES DONE AND TOLD ME "I don't know why you hate me I don't know what I did to you to make you feel like this towards me I've been nothing but a good father_

Then I'm making food and he just walks into the work kitchen and looks at me and goes "I want you to know I love you with all my heart I want what's best for you"

**then at 6pm** i got called downstairs for a family meeting to "sort me and dads relationship" and i made the stupid choice of being honest and telling him how i feel and he snapped and said "well none of that is true get it out of your fucking head we never yelled at you you didnt have a bad childhood and ii feel like im breaking in two im trying not to cry so loud i got yelled at for saying "sir" when i have memories of him telling me to call him that and he swears he never did and the conversation grew into him telling me everything I remember from my childhood wasn't real and now I don't know what's real or what isn't, and hes also like "yes this is how you feel but facts are facts and facts speak over feelings" anytime stuff like this happens he ends it with two things he wans me to remembers that are true 1) that he helped deliver me and that i was one of the happiest moments in his life and 2) hes told everyone hes ever worked with how happy and proud of me he is if i get defensive he yells and snaps at me until i act docile...i i mentioned how when ive shown them something ive done and tey dont sound interested that never happened he he said "i dont know where down the line you got this idea that we hit you and fucking abused you but get it out of your head" he said "ive told everyone ive ever worked with how proud of you i am" but hes never told me that except after hes mentally broken me i got in trouble today for not making conversation with them in the beginning of it and when i pointed out that ive tried and ive gotten nothing towards the end hes like "its not you its me" he he also wanted me to tell him what i thought about my childhood and him and mom and when i said "im not comfy with that" he immediatly went to "well i think you think im abusive" i know better than to say what i really thought... the part that hurts me is he wants me to act like i do around you two jen and k (my just "friends") around him and mom... my dad wanted to meet my therapist to "set things straight" and said i wasnt comfy with that and he lost it

"we wanted you to go down the path you wanted" Ok then why did I feel like I couldn't take a trade school path? Why do I have memories of mom telling me I'm better off in college prep "It was you who did that not us"

**Then as i am going to bed** my mom knocks on my door asking if im ok and i just say im going to bed. 

I did send my therapist everything and i... god
