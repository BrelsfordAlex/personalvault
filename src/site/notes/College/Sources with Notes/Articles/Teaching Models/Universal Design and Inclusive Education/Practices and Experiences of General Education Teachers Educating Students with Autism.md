## Teaching Methods Used for Students with Autism

The paper outlines several teaching methods employed by general education teachers to support students with autism. These methods are designed to enhance communication, self-regulation, social interaction, and academic engagement. Here are the key strategies:

- **Technology-aided Instruction**: Teachers used technology such as tablets and computer software to facilitate academic engagement. Examples include allowing students to complete tasks using computer programs, using voice-to-text software, and video-recording presentations for class playback .
    
- **Scaffolding**: This involves breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps or "chunks" to help students complete portions of work incrementally, allowing them to experience small successes along the way .
    
- **Incorporating Student Interests**: Teachers integrated students' interests into academic tasks to boost motivation and engagement. For instance, a student interested in dinosaurs was allowed to write about them, and another student created a multiplication video using technology .
    
- **Priming**: Teachers used priming to let students preview expectations of tasks or activities, which helped in addressing social, communication, behavioral, and academic skills. This strategy was also referred to as "front loading" .
    
- **Modeling**: Both adult and peer modeling were used to support communication and behavioral skills. Teachers demonstrated expected responses through verbal modeling to aid communication skills .
    
- **Educating Peers**: Teachers emphasized the importance of educating typically developing peers about diversity and differences to promote successful inclusion and address issues like bullying .
    
- **Visual Supports and Sentence Starters**: These were used to aid communication and task completion, providing students with clear examples and structured guidance .
    
- **Peer-mediated Support and Reinforcement**: These strategies involved using peers to facilitate social interactions and providing positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors .
    

## Understanding Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework aimed at improving and optimizing teaching and learning for all individuals based on scientific insights into how humans learn. Here are the key aspects of UDL as discussed in the paper:

- **Framework for Educational Practice**: UDL is described as a scientifically valid framework that guides educational practice. It is designed to support diverse learners by recognizing individual learning differences and creating flexible learning environments .
    
- **Multiple Means of Engagement, Representation, Action, and Expression**: UDL emphasizes providing students with multiple ways to engage with content, represent their understanding, and express what they know. This approach helps accommodate different learning styles and needs, ensuring that all students have equal opportunities to succeed .
    
- **Positive Influence on Inclusion**: UDL positively impacts inclusion efforts by offering strategies that can be adapted to meet the needs of all students, including those with autism. Teachers reported using UDL strategies to facilitate inclusion, such as using technology to modify tasks and allowing physical movement breaks .
    
- **Constructivist Philosophy**: UDL shares a constructivist philosophy, which aligns with evidence-based naturalistic autism interventions. This philosophy supports the idea that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflecting on those experiences .
    
- **Teacher Feedback and Implementation**: Teachers generally had positive feedback about UDL, noting that it aligns with their existing practices and helps them modify strategies to meet diverse student needs. They often incorporate students' preferences into activities to increase motivation and engagement .
    

## Implementing UDL Strategies in the Classroom

Teachers implement Universal Design for Learning (UDL) strategies in various ways to accommodate the diverse needs of students, including those with autism. Here are some methods highlighted in the paper:

- **Incorporating Student Preferences**: Teachers often recruit student interest by integrating their preferences into activities. This approach increases motivation and engagement, making learning more personalized and effective .
    
- **Providing Multiple Means of Expression**: Teachers offer students different ways to express their knowledge, such as through art projects, posters, or oral presentations. This flexibility allows students to choose the modality that best suits their strengths and preferences .
    
- **Utilizing Technology**: Technology plays a significant role in UDL implementation. Teachers use tablets and computer software to modify tasks, ensuring that all students, including those with autism, can participate without feeling singled out. This approach helps in creating an inclusive classroom environment .
    
- **Allowing Physical Movement**: Recognizing the need for physical action, teachers allow students to take breaks for movement. This strategy supports self-regulation and helps students maintain focus and engagement during learning activities .
    
- **Explicit Teaching of Self-Regulation**: Teachers provide explicit instruction in self-regulation strategies to help students manage their emotions and behaviors. This is crucial for creating a supportive learning environment where all students can thrive .
    
- **Sequencing and Comprehension Aids**: Teachers use tools like sequencing cards to aid reading comprehension, offering alternative ways for students to demonstrate understanding. This method supports diverse learning styles and helps ensure that all students can access the curriculum .
    

## Highly Effective UDL Strategies

The paper highlights several Universal Design for Learning (UDL) strategies that teachers found to be particularly effective in supporting students with autism in inclusive classrooms:

- **Multiple Means of Engagement**: Teachers reported that providing students with various ways to engage with the material was effective. This includes incorporating student interests into lessons, which helps to increase motivation and engagement. For example, allowing a student interested in dinosaurs to write about them instead of a different assigned topic was found to be beneficial .
    
- **Multiple Means of Action and Expression**: Offering students different ways to express their knowledge and understanding was another effective strategy. Teachers used technology, such as tablets and computer software, to modify tasks and provide alternative ways for students to complete assignments. This approach helps students feel included and supports diverse learning needs .
    
- **Physical Movement and Breaks**: Allowing students to take breaks for physical movement was highlighted as an effective strategy. This helps students with self-regulation and maintains their focus and engagement during learning activities. Teachers provided options for physical action, such as allowing students to move around or use different seating options like rocker chairs and wobble stools .
    
- **Technology-Aided Instruction**: The use of technology to facilitate academic engagement was frequently mentioned. Teachers used tools like voice-to-text software and video recording to help students complete tasks in ways that suited their abilities and preferences. This strategy was effective in making learning more accessible and inclusive for students with autism .
    

## Assessing the Effectiveness of UDL Strategies

The paper provides insights into how teachers assessed the effectiveness of UDL strategies in their classrooms, particularly for students with autism:

- **Positive Feedback and Observations**: Teachers generally provided positive feedback regarding the use of UDL strategies. They observed that these strategies were beneficial not only for students with autism but for all students in the classroom. Teachers noted that UDL strategies helped in modifying teaching practices to meet the diverse needs of students, which they found to be effective in promoting inclusion and engagement .
    
- **Student Engagement and Motivation**: Teachers assessed the effectiveness of UDL strategies by observing increased student engagement and motivation. By incorporating students' interests into activities, teachers noticed that students were more motivated to participate and engage in tasks. This was seen as a direct indicator of the effectiveness of UDL strategies in capturing students' attention and facilitating learning .
    
- **Variety in Expression and Communication**: The effectiveness of UDL strategies was also assessed through the variety of options provided for students to express their knowledge. Teachers reported that offering different modalities for students to demonstrate their understanding, such as through art projects, posters, or oral presentations, was effective in accommodating diverse learning styles and needs .
    
- **Self-Regulation and Emotional Regulation**: Teachers evaluated the effectiveness of UDL strategies by observing improvements in students' self-regulation and emotional regulation. Providing explicit teaching and self-regulation strategies helped students manage their emotions better, which was seen as a positive outcome of implementing UDL strategies .
