# Notes

## Introduction

- Educators face challenges in effectively educating students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
    
- Students with ASD often exhibit social communication impairments and challenging behaviors.
    
- Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses like ADHD and anxiety disorders are common in these students.
    
- Rising ASD prevalence increases the demand for effective educational strategies.
    
- Evidence-based practices (EBPs) exist but are rarely implemented systematically in schools.
    
- Barriers include complexity of EBPs and insufficient teacher training.
    
- Teachers often adapt EBPs, but effectiveness of these adaptations is unclear.
    
- There is growing interest in bridging the research-to-practice gap in autism education.
    
- Implementation science has shifted towards collaborative, community-based approaches.
    
- Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) is an EBP adapted for educational settings.
    
- PRT targets pivotal skills to improve overall functioning in children with ASD.
    
- Positive outcomes from PRT have been reported, but research on school-aged children is limited.
    
- Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT) was developed to adapt PRT for classroom use.
    
- Studies showed teachers implemented some CPRT techniques with fidelity, but others needed improvement.
    
- Further research is needed to assess CPRT's effectiveness in special education settings in the Netherlands.
    

## Setting and Participants

- The study took place in special schools for primary education in the Netherlands.
    
- Inclusion criteria for teachers included experience and no prior PRT training.
    
- Students needed a clinical ASD diagnosis, IQ above 80, and specific age and educational plan.
    
- Seven teachers and seven students participated, with teachers averaging 20.4 years of experience.
    

## Design

- A concurrent multiple baseline design across three groups was used for the study.
    
- Groups were randomly assigned baseline lengths to ensure simultaneous training participation.
    

## Pre-baseline

- Three pre-baseline sessions familiarized teachers and students with videotaping.
    
- Instruction was provided in various subjects without data collection on dependent variables.
    

## Baseline

- Baseline sessions involved small-group instruction without feedback on CPRT implementation.
    
- Teachers conducted planned activity checks to measure maladaptive behavior.
    

## Intervention

- CPRT training included group sessions and individual coaching by certified trainers.
    
- Group sessions covered ABA principles and CPRT components through various instructional methods.
    
- Teachers practiced CPRT techniques and received feedback on their implementation.
    

## Post-intervention

- Post-intervention sessions evaluated maintenance of skills immediately after CPRT training.
    
- Teachers continued to measure maladaptive behavior during these sessions.
    

## Follow-up

- Follow-up sessions assessed skill maintenance three months after the last post-intervention session.
    

## Fidelity of CPRT Implementation

- Fidelity was measured using partial interval recording of CPRT components.
    
- Observers recorded whether teachers implemented key CPRT techniques during instruction.
    

## Communication Skills

- Communication skills were measured through initiations and responses during small-group instruction.
    
- Observers recorded contextually appropriate attempts to initiate or respond to interactions.
    

## Maladaptive Behavior

- Maladaptive behavior was measured using PLACHECKs to assess student engagement and disruptive behaviors.
    
- Teachers recorded instances of maladaptive behavior during instructional time.
    

## Social Validity

- Teachers rated the social validity of CPRT training as informative and pleasant.
    
- Feedback indicated a high recommendation for CPRT training among teachers.
    

## Interobserver Agreement

- Interobserver agreement was assessed by independent observers coding videotapes.
    
- Training ensured observers accurately recorded fidelity and communication skills.
    

## Treatment Integrity

- Treatment integrity data indicated high percentages for training and coaching sessions.
    
- Independent observers assessed treatment integrity to ensure consistency in training delivery.
    

## Data-analysis

- Data were visually analyzed and statistically assessed for changes in fidelity, communication skills, and maladaptive behavior.
    
- Effect sizes were calculated to evaluate the impact of CPRT training.
    

## Discussion

- The pilot study examined CPRT training effectiveness on teacher fidelity and student outcomes.
    
- Teacher satisfaction was high, but fidelity improvements were inconsistent across participants.
    
- Small, non-significant changes in student communication skills and maladaptive behavior were observed.
    
- Variability in teaching activities and student numbers may have affected fidelity and outcomes.
    
- Recommendations include individualized training and further research on CPRT effectiveness in diverse settings.
    

## Teaching Methods Used in the Paper

- **Group Sessions**: Teachers participated in three two-hour group sessions conducted biweekly. These sessions introduced teachers to Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), the ABC pattern of behavior, and ==Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT)==. The sessions included didactic instruction, video examples, worksheets, and role-plays to teach antecedent and consequent CPRT components .
    
- **Individual Coaching Sessions**: Following the group sessions, teachers received individual coaching approximately two weeks after the third group session. These sessions were conducted weekly and involved practicing CPRT components during small-group instruction. Trainers observed and videotaped the instruction, providing feedback based on the video .
    
- **Video Feedback Protocol**: During coaching sessions, trainers used a structured video feedback protocol. This included providing positive feedback for correct use of CPRT components, corrective feedback for incorrect use, and suggestions for improvement. Trainers also made positive statements at regular intervals during the video review .
    
- **Practice and Feedback**: Teachers were instructed to practice CPRT components during small-group instruction and videotape their sessions. Feedback was provided on their implementation during subsequent group sessions, focusing on both correct and incorrect use of CPRT components .
    
- **Materials and Resources**: Teachers received a manual, a copy of "Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching for Children with Autism," and a summary of each session. These resources supported their learning and implementation of CPRT techniques .
    
- **Goal Setting and Data Collection**: Teachers were taught to set goals and collect data on these goals, which helped in assessing the fidelity of CPRT implementation .
    

These methods aimed to equip teachers with the skills necessary to implement CPRT effectively in their classrooms, although the study found variability in the fidelity of implementation among teachers .

## Specific CPRT Components Taught

- **Antecedent Components**:
    
    - **Gaining the Student's Attention**: Teachers were trained to effectively capture and maintain the student's focus during instruction .
        
    - **Presenting Clear and Appropriate Cues**: Instruction included how to provide clear signals or prompts to guide student responses .
        
    - **Interspersing Maintenance and Acquisition Tasks**: Teachers learned to balance tasks that maintain existing skills with those that introduce new skills .
        
    - **Sharing Control**: This component involved allowing students some choice and control over their learning activities to increase engagement .
        
    - **Using Multiple Cues**: Teachers were taught to use a variety of cues, such as verbal instructions and non-verbal signals, to enhance learning .
        
- **Prompting**: Instruction on how to effectively prompt students to elicit desired responses was provided .
    
- **Consequent Components**:
    
    - **Providing Direct and Contingent Reinforcement**: Teachers were trained to offer immediate and appropriate reinforcement following a student's correct response or reasonable attempt .
        
    - **Reinforcing Attempts**: Teachers learned to acknowledge and reinforce students' efforts, even if the response was not entirely correct, to encourage continued participation and learning .
        

These components were taught using a combination of didactic instruction, video examples, worksheets, and role-plays to ensure teachers could implement them effectively in their classrooms .

## Main Challenge in Educating Students with ASD

- **Complex Educational Needs**: Educators face significant challenges in meeting the complex educational needs of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These students often require tailored educational strategies to improve their social, behavioral, and academic outcomes .
    
- **Impairments and Behaviors**: Students with ASD typically have impairments in social communication and interaction. They may also exhibit restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors, along with challenging behaviors such as disruptive actions, elopement, aggression, and self-injurious behavior. These factors make it difficult for educators to provide effective instruction .
    
- **Comorbid Psychiatric Diagnoses**: Many students with ASD also have comorbid psychiatric conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and anxiety disorders. These additional challenges can further hinder their success in educational settings by negatively impacting teachers' instructional efforts and reducing learning opportunities .
    
- **Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs)**: Although several EBPs have been developed to teach functional skills and reduce challenging behaviors in students with ASD, few have been systematically implemented in educational settings. The complexity of these practices and limited teacher training are significant barriers. Additionally, most EBPs are designed for one-to-one interventions, which may not fit well in group classroom settings .
    
- **Adaptation of Practices**: Teachers often need to adapt or combine EBPs to fit their teaching preferences and the educational needs of their students. However, it is often unclear whether these modified interventions are as effective as the original practices .
    

These challenges highlight the need for effective training and support for educators to implement strategies that address the diverse needs of students with ASD in school settings.

## Specific Strategies Used in CPRT

Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT) incorporates several specific strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experience for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These strategies are designed to be implemented during small-group instruction and focus on maximizing student engagement and learning. Here are the key strategies used in CPRT:

- **Maximizing Student Motivation**: Teachers are encouraged to enhance student motivation by incorporating choices, following the student's interests, and facilitating turn-taking. This involves allowing students to choose between activities, materials, or topics, and engaging them in activities that align with their interests .
    
- **Three-Term Contingency Learning Trials**: This strategy involves creating structured learning opportunities that consist of three components: gaining the student's attention, presenting a clear and appropriate cue, and reinforcing the student's response. Teachers are expected to contrive at least two complete three-term contingencies during an interval to ensure effective learning .
    
- **Interspersing Maintenance and Acquisition Trials**: Teachers are trained to balance maintenance and acquisition trials by presenting at least three different cues or prompts in two consecutive intervals. This approach helps in reinforcing previously learned skills while introducing new concepts .
    
- **Use of Video Modeling**: Teachers implement CPRT during small-group instruction by interspersing maintenance and acquisition trials, which is often supported by video modeling. This method provides a visual reference for teachers to understand and apply CPRT strategies effectively .
    

These strategies are part of a broader effort to adapt Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) for classroom settings, ensuring that teachers can implement these techniques with fidelity and improve educational outcomes for students with ASD. The focus on motivation, structured learning trials, and balanced instruction are central to the CPRT approach.

## Changes in Students' Communication Skills

- **Lack of Significant Changes**: The study found that changes in students' communication skills were small and non-significant. This suggests that the implementation of Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT) did not lead to substantial improvements in the communication abilities of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during the study period .
    
- **Variability in Student Responses**: The data on student responses during the intervention were variable. While some students showed an increasing trend in their responses, others exhibited a decreasing trend or no trend at all. This variability indicates that the impact of CPRT on communication skills was inconsistent across different students .
    
- **Baseline and Post-Intervention Trends**: During the baseline phase, the median percentage of responses varied, and this variability continued into the post-intervention phase. Although there was a decreasing trend in responses for some students during the post-intervention period, the changes were not significant compared to the intervention phase .
    
- **Potential Factors Affecting Outcomes**: The study suggests that the variability in CPRT implementation fidelity and the number of students participating in small-group instruction might have influenced the outcomes. An increase in the number of students could reduce the opportunities for each student to initiate or respond, potentially affecting their communication skill development .
    

Overall, the study concluded that CPRT did not result in significant improvements in students' communication skills, highlighting the need for further research to explore the factors that could enhance the effectiveness of CPRT in educational settings.
