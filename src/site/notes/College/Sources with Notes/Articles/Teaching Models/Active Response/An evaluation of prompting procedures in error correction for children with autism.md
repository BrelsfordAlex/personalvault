# Notes
## Participants and Setting

- Four children with ASD or PDD participated, diagnosed by pediatricians in China.
    
- Lam, a 7-year-old girl, had advanced verbal skills and 3.5 years of intervention.
    
- Wen, a 4-year-old boy, could request items and read age-appropriate Chinese words.
    
- Kang, a 7-year-old boy with PDD, could label pictures and answer wh-questions.
    
- Jin, a 6-year-old girl, had a sophisticated verbal repertoire and could read Chinese.
    
- All children had more exposure to echoic prompts than picture prompts.
    
- Fluency assessments on tact and echoic responding were conducted prior to the study.
    
- Assessments involved naming pictures and echoic targets, with varying performance rates.
    
- All children were scheduled for inclusive education programs in the upcoming school year.
    
- Study sessions were conducted in individual intervention rooms measuring approximately 5 ft by 7 ft.
    

## English Words and Picture Prompts

- Parents selected English-to-Chinese translation as the target skill for participants.
    
- Participants' previous exposure to English words was assessed before testing.
    
- English words were printed on index cards for translation to Chinese.
    
- Pictures corresponding to English words were also used for labeling.
    
- A total of 40 English words were selected for each participant based on specific criteria.
    
- Words were divided for repeated comparisons, ensuring similar letter counts.
    
- Chinese translations varied between one to two characters.
    

## Reinforcers

- A preference assessment identified potential reinforcers for participants before sessions.
    
- Participants selected one item from a sequence of edible and leisure items.
    
- The selection process was repeated until all items were chosen or no selection occurred.
    
- The frequency of item selection was calculated to determine the most preferred reinforcer.
    

## Dependent Measures

- The primary measure was the percentage of correct responses in translations.
    
- Correct responses were defined as accurate translations within 5 seconds.
    
- Efficiency was evaluated by the total number of sessions and trials to mastery.
    

## Experimental Design

- An adapted alternating treatments design was used with a multiple baseline across participants.
    
- This design allowed for quick comparisons of the effects of two procedures.
    
- The order of procedures was alternated to minimize sequence effects.
    
- Each participant experienced two comparisons to demonstrate replication of effects.
    

## Baseline

- Each baseline session consisted of 20 trials targeting English words.
    
- Trials began with an English word presentation followed by a translation instruction.
    
- Correct translations were scored within 5 seconds, with intertrial intervals implemented.
    
- No prompts or consequences were provided during baseline trials.
    

## General Procedure

- Each treatment session involved active student response with echoic or picture prompts.
    
- Mastery was defined as at least 90% correct responses across three sessions.
    
- Sessions began with the presentation of an English word and instruction for translation.
    
- Reinforcers were delivered for correct responses, with error correction procedures applied as needed.
    

## Active Student Response with an Echoic Prompt

- In the echoic-prompt condition, an echoic model was provided after an error.
    
- Participants were asked to repeat the translation, with praise given for correct responses.
    
- The correction procedure was conducted once for each error.
    

## Active Student Response with a Picture Prompt

- The picture prompt condition involved showing a corresponding picture instead of an echoic model.
    
- Participants were asked to provide the Chinese translation after seeing the picture.
    
- Praise was delivered for correct responses, and trials proceeded similarly to the echoic condition.
    

## Follow-Up

- Follow-up probes were conducted one month after mastering all English words.
    
- The procedure for follow-up was the same as the baseline procedure.
    

## Procedural Integrity and Interobserver Agreement

- A procedural integrity checklist was developed for baseline and treatment procedures.
    
- A second observer collected data on procedural integrity and interobserver agreement.
    
- High percentages of procedural integrity were maintained across sessions.
    

## Results

- All participants mastered targets after introducing error-correction procedures.
    
- Lam showed faster mastery with picture prompts compared to echoic prompts.
    
- Similar trends were observed for other participants, with varying rates of acquisition.
    
- Follow-up results indicated maintenance of learned translations for most participants.
    

## Discussion

- The study compared error correction methods for teaching English-to-Chinese translations.
    
- Picture prompts were found to be more efficient for skill acquisition in most comparisons.
    
- Differences in total trials were more sensitive than total sessions for measuring efficiency.
    
- Future studies should explore additional prompting procedures and their effects on learning.
    
- Limitations included potential differences in stimulus difficulty and generalizability of results.
    

## Teaching Methods Mentioned in the Paper

> [!NOTE]
> - **Active Student Response with Echoic Prompts**: This method involves providing an echoic model (i.e., the correct verbal response) after an error is made by the student. The student is then asked to repeat the translation, and praise is given for correct responses. This correction procedure is conducted once for each error.
>     
> - **Active Student Response with Picture Prompts**: In this approach, a picture corresponding to the English word is shown to the student instead of providing an echoic model. The student is then asked to provide the Chinese translation after seeing the picture, and praise is delivered for correct responses. The trials proceed similarly to the echoic condition.
>     
> - **Error Correction Procedures**: The study compared different error correction methods, specifically focusing on active student response with echoic and picture prompts. These methods are used to facilitate skill acquisition in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by correcting errors during learning tasks .
>     
> - **Reinforcement**: Reinforcers were used to encourage correct responses. A preference assessment was conducted to identify potential reinforcers, which included edible and leisure items. The most preferred reinforcer was determined based on the frequency of item selection by the participants .
>     
> 
> These methods were evaluated for their effectiveness in teaching English-to-Chinese translations to children with ASD, with the study finding that picture prompts were generally more efficient in facilitating skill acquisition .
