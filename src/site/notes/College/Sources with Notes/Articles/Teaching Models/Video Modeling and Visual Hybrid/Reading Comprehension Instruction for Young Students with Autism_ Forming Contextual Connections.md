## Teaching Methods for Reading Comprehension in Students with Autism

- **Targeted Reading Comprehension Intervention**: This method involved a four-month intervention focusing on vocabulary, main idea, text structure, and anaphoric relations. It consisted of 48 sessions and showed significant improvements in students' comprehension abilities compared to a control group receiving standard instruction .
    
- **Anaphoric Cuing**: This technique involved underscoring pronouns in a passage and providing students with a choice of three referent words. This method was effective in improving reading comprehension by forcing coherence processing and supporting the use of cohesive devices .
    
- **Instruction in Semantic Ambiguity**: This approach taught students to identify semantic ambiguities, such as homonyms, and understand multiple meanings of words. The use of the Amelia Bedelia series helped in teaching semantic ambiguity, which showed significant results in reading comprehension .
    
- **Coherence Processing Strategies**: The study aimed to teach students metacognitive skills to look for context cues in narratives. This involved strategies to improve coherence processing, such as disambiguating multiple meaning words, resolving anaphors, retelling stories in sequence, detecting semantic mismatches, and making causal inferences .
    
- **Use of Visual Materials and Sequence Words**: Instruction included visual materials to help students think about characters' actions within the story context. Direct instruction in using sequence words was also emphasized to improve comprehension and retelling abilities .
    

These methods were designed to address the specific challenges faced by students with autism in reading comprehension, focusing on enhancing their ability to make coherence connections and understand narrative texts.

## Benefits of the Instructional Intervention on Children's Comprehension

- **Improved Narrative Retelling**: The instructional intervention significantly enhanced the children's ability to retell narrative texts. This improvement was particularly evident in the quality of retellings, which included better sequencing of story events and more detailed references to character actions and settings. This suggests that the intervention effectively supported coherence processing, a critical component of reading comprehension .
    
- **Use of Sequence Words**: First graders in the intervention group showed a marked improvement in their use of sequence words when retelling stories. This indicates that the intervention was successful in teaching these students to organize their thoughts and convey the sequence of events more clearly, which is an essential skill for understanding and communicating narrative content .
    
- **Enhanced Coherence Processing**: The intervention was designed to foster coherence processing by teaching students to monitor context cues actively. This approach helped students with autism to make better coherence connections, which are vital for understanding narrative texts. The intervention's focus on metacognitive skills and context cues was instrumental in achieving these outcomes .
    
- **Significant Effects on Retelling Measures**: The study found significant effects on the retelling measures used in the Fountas and Pinnell posttest assessment. This indicates that the intervention not only improved the students' ability to retell stories but also had a measurable impact on their overall reading comprehension abilities .
    
- **Implications for Reading Instruction**: The findings suggest that targeted instructional interventions can be beneficial for children with autism, particularly in enhancing their narrative comprehension skills. This has important implications for designing reading instruction that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population .

By focusing on their existing skills, such as word reading, educators can create a more effective learning environment that fosters growth in areas where students may have deficits, such as reading comprehension .
    
- **Use of Visual Supports**: Incorporating visual materials into reading instruction can cue students to think about characters' actions and the context of the story. This approach helps guide students in constructing meaning from the text, which is crucial for improving comprehension .
    
- **Focus on Coherence Processing**: The intervention demonstrated the benefits of teaching coherence processing skills, such as sequencing story events and using sequence words. These skills are essential for understanding narrative texts and should be a focus in reading instruction for students with autism .
    
- **Addressing Executive Function Deficits**: Since executive function is often a deficit area for individuals with autism, reading instruction should include strategies to improve these skills. Enhancing executive function can lead to better coherence processing and reading comprehension .
    
- **Need for Larger Scale Studies**: The study suggests that further research is needed to determine the broader applicability of these instructional strategies. Larger scale studies could provide more definitive evidence of the benefits of coherence processing instruction for children with autism .
    
- **Adapting Instructional Measures**: The study indicates that adaptations may be necessary for younger students, as some tasks may be too easy or confusing. Tailoring instructional measures to the specific needs and abilities of students can improve the effectiveness of reading interventions .
    

These implications underscore the need for intentional and tailored reading instruction that addresses the unique challenges faced by children with autism, ultimately aiming to improve their reading comprehension and overall academic success.
