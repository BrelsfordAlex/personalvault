## Teaching Methods in the Article

- **Schema-Based Instruction (SBI):** The study utilized a modified schema-based instructional approach to teach students with mild intellectual disability (MID) to solve word problems. This method involved using schematic diagrams to help students understand and solve change story situations without an unknown .
    
- **Self-Instruction and Modeling:** Students were taught to use a self-instruction list and follow a structured model, lead, and test format. This approach included explicit instructions and modeling of problem-solving steps, such as underlining actions, circling the largest amount, and checking solutions .
    
- **Use of Manipulatives:** Instructors used concrete materials to model problem situations, especially when students had difficulty understanding the story. This hands-on approach helped students visualize and comprehend the problems better .
    
- **Flexible Instructional Scripts:** Teachers were provided with scripts containing flexible instructions, allowing them to adapt based on the students' difficulties. For example, if a student struggled to identify the larger amount, manipulatives were used to model the situation .
    
- **Focus on Inconsistent Problems:** The instruction included practice with inconsistent problems, where the operation required was contrary to the action of the verb. This was emphasized to help students overcome inherent difficulties in such problems .
    
- **Structured Sessions:** Instructional sessions were held weekly, early in the morning, in a distraction-free environment. This consistent and structured setting was designed to optimize learning for the students .
    
- **Generalization and Maintenance:** The teaching methods were designed to generalize problem-solving skills to untrained settings and maintain these skills over time, as evidenced by the students' performance 8 weeks post-instruction .
    

These methods collectively aimed to improve the mathematical problem-solving abilities of students with MID by providing structured, adaptable, and supportive instructional strategies.

## Improvement in Students' Performance Post-Intervention

- **Overall Improvement:** All three participants showed significant improvement in solving one-step addition and subtraction change word problems after the schema-based instruction (SBI) intervention. This indicates that the instructional approach was effective in enhancing their problem-solving skills .
    
- **Performance Metrics:** The percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND) was used to measure the effect size of the intervention. For Student A, the PND index was 100%, classifying the intervention as very effective. Student B had a PND of 71.4%, and Student C had a PND of 85.7%, both classified as effective .
    
- **Session Performance:** After the first intervention session, all three students achieved a 100% success rate in solving change stories, and this performance was maintained in the subsequent session with consistent problems. When inconsistent problems were introduced, there was a temporary decrease in performance, but all students quickly adapted, achieving high success rates in subsequent sessions .
    
- **Baseline vs. Intervention:** During the baseline sessions, Student A had a stable success rate between 60% and 70%, while Students B and C had results below 50%. Post-intervention, all students showed marked improvement, with performance exceeding baseline levels .
    
- **Generalization and Maintenance:** The skills learned during the intervention were generalized to two-step addition and subtraction word problems and maintained eight weeks after the instruction, demonstrating the lasting impact of the intervention .
    

Overall, the schema-based instructional approach significantly improved the students' ability to solve mathematical word problems, with effects that were both generalized and maintained over time.

## Strategies Used in Schema-Based Instruction (SBI)

- **Modified Schema-Based Instructional Approach:** The study utilized a modified version of schema-based instruction to improve the mathematical word problem-solving performance of students with mild intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. This approach was tailored to address the specific needs of these students .
    
- **Gradual Introduction of Problem Types:** The intervention began with consistent problems and gradually introduced inconsistent problems. This step-by-step approach helped students adapt to different types of word problems, improving their understanding and problem-solving skills .
    
- **Use of Pictorial Task Analysis and Graphic Organizers:** Although not explicitly detailed in the contexts, modified SBI approaches often include pictorial task analysis and graphic organizers. These tools help students visualize and organize information, making it easier to understand and solve problems .
    
- **Systematic Prompting with Feedback:** Systematic prompting, combined with feedback, is a strategy used in modified SBI to guide students through problem-solving steps. This method helps reinforce learning and correct errors in real-time .
    
- **Concrete and Virtual Manipulatives:** The use of manipulatives, both concrete and virtual, is another strategy that can be part of modified SBI. These tools provide hands-on experiences that help students grasp abstract mathematical concepts more concretely .
    
- **Focus on Addition and Subtraction Change Problems:** The study specifically focused on addition and subtraction change problems, analyzing the instructional aspects that helped students overcome difficulties, especially with inconsistent problems .
    

## Understanding FAU, CAU, and IAU in the Study

- **FAU (Find the Amount Unknown):** This type of problem involves scenarios where the task is to find an unknown quantity. The instruction sessions included FAU review problems to help students practice identifying and solving these types of problems .
    
- **CAU (Change Amount Unknown):** CAU problems are those where the change in quantity is unknown. These problems are categorized into "get more" and "get less" scenarios. For example, in a "get more" problem, students might need to determine how many more items were added to reach a final total. The instruction sessions for CAU problems included both consistent and inconsistent problems, where the operation might not directly match the action described by the verb in the problem .
    
- **IAU (Initial Amount Unknown):** IAU problems involve finding the initial quantity before a change occurred. These problems also include "get more" and "get less" scenarios. For instance, in a "get less" problem, students might need to determine the starting amount before some items were lost. The instruction for IAU problems required students to practice identifying when addition or subtraction was necessary to find the solution .
    

These problem types were integral to the schema-based instruction approach used in the study, helping students with mild intellectual disabilities improve their problem-solving skills in mathematical word problems.

## Impact of FAU Problems on Student Performance

- **Initial Success with FAU Problems:** After the first intervention session focused on learning change stories, the students achieved a 100% success rate with FAU problems. This indicates that the students were able to effectively apply the schema-based instruction to solve these types of problems, which are considered consistent problems .
    
- **Foundation for Introducing More Complex Problems:** The success with FAU problems allowed the researchers to introduce CAU problems in subsequent sessions. The students' ability to solve FAU problems provided a strong foundation for tackling more complex and inconsistent problem types, although there was a noted decrease in performance when CAU problems were first introduced .
    
- **Role in Generalization and Maintenance:** The skills learned through solving FAU problems contributed to the students' ability to generalize their problem-solving skills to other types of word problems, including two-step problems. The performance improvements were maintained even 8 weeks after the instruction, suggesting that the foundational skills developed through FAU problems had a lasting impact .
    
- **Assessment and Evaluation:** FAU problems were included in the evaluation probes to assess the students' understanding and ability to apply the learned strategies independently. The inclusion of FAU problems in these assessments helped ensure that students could consistently apply their problem-solving skills across different contexts .
