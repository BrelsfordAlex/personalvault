# Notes
## Introduction

- Autism diagnostic criteria include social communication impairments and repetitive behaviors.
    
- Autistic individuals may struggle with language, affecting learning and task completion.
    
- Evidence-based practices (EBP) are essential for effective interventions for autistic individuals.
    
- Applied behavior analysis (ABA) principles guide many effective interventions for skill acquisition.
    
- Visual supports and video modeling are two EBPs for teaching skills to autistic individuals.
    
- Visual supports enhance understanding of routines and expected behaviors across various skills.
    
- Digital activity schedules improve engagement and independence, offering advantages over traditional methods.
    
- Video modeling helps learners focus on relevant stimuli for task completion.
    
- Combining digital activity schedules with video modeling creates video activity schedules for enhanced learning.
    
- Systematic reviews have evaluated video modeling but often focus on specific components or populations.
    
- This review aims to synthesize literature on video activity schedules for autistic individuals and identify research gaps.
    

## Inclusion Criteria

- Findings indicate a need for more diverse participant representation in future research.
    

## SCARF Assessment Criteria

The Single-Case Analysis Review Framework (SCARF) is used to evaluate the quality, rigor, and outcomes of single-case design studies. Here are the specific assessment criteria used by SCARF:

- **Quality (External Validity):**
    
    - Evaluated on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates the lowest quality and 4 indicates the highest.
        
    - Quality variables include participant demographics, dependent variable, condition, and social and ecological validity .
        
- **Rigor (Internal Validity):**
    
    - Also evaluated on a 0 to 4 scale but is double-weighted.
        
    - Assesses variables such as reliability, fidelity, and sufficiency of data .
        
- **Primary Outcomes:**
    
    - Visual analysis is used to code the strength of the functional relation on a 0 to 4 scale.
        
    - A score of 0 indicates consistent noneffects, while a score of 4 indicates strong demonstration of effects .
        
- **Generalization and Maintenance:**
    
    - Generalization evaluates how it was measured (e.g., response or stimulus, pre-post evaluation, post-test only).
        
    - Maintenance evaluates the time point at which it was measured after the study (e.g., immediately after, up to 1 month after, more than 1 month after) .
        
- **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    
    - Scores at or above 2.0 are considered high quality, and scores of 1.8 are satisfactory for confidence in interpreting outcomes .
        
- **Functional Relation:**
    
    - Determined by three demonstrations of effect, sufficient data points, and anticipated baseline changes .

## Understanding SCARF

The Single-Case Analysis Review Framework (SCARF) is a methodological tool used to evaluate the quality, rigor, and outcomes of single-case design studies. Here are the key aspects of SCARF:

- **Purpose:**
    
    - SCARF is designed to assess the methodological quality and rigor of single-case research, particularly in studies involving interventions like video activity schedules for autistic individuals .
        
- **Evaluation Criteria:**
    
    - SCARF evaluates both the internal and external validity of studies. Internal validity, or rigor, is assessed by examining factors such as reliability, fidelity, and data sufficiency, and is double-weighted in the scoring process .
        
    - External validity, or quality, is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, considering participant demographics, dependent variables, conditions, and social and ecological validity .
        
- **Outcome Measurement:**
    
    - SCARF uses visual analysis to code the strength of the functional relation between variables, using a scale from 0 to 4. This helps in determining the effectiveness of the intervention being studied .
        
    - It also evaluates generalization and maintenance of outcomes, considering how and when these were measured post-study .
        
- **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    
    - Scores of 2.0 or above are considered high quality, while scores of 1.8 are deemed satisfactory for interpreting study outcomes confidently .
        
- **Application:**
    
    - SCARF is applied to studies that are either demonstrative or comparative in nature, focusing on the effects of interventions like video activity schedules compared to baseline performances or other interventions .
        

## Teaching Methods for Autistic Individuals

The paper discusses several teaching methods used for autistic individuals, particularly focusing on evidence-based practices. Here are the key methods mentioned:

- **Video Activity Schedules:**
    
    - This method combines video modeling with activity schedules to teach various skills to autistic individuals. It is a type of video-based instruction that has been systematically reviewed in the paper .
        
- **Video Modeling:**
    
    - Video modeling is an evidence-based practice that involves demonstrating a desired behavior or skill through video. It is frequently used for skill acquisition in autistic individuals.
        
- **Visual Supports:**
    
    - Visual supports are another evidence-based practice based on the principles of behavior analysis. They are used to help autistic individuals acquire new skills by providing visual cues and aids.
        
- **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA):**
    
    - ABA is a widely used and empirically validated intervention for autistic individuals. It focuses on using behavior analytic principles to teach new skills and reduce undesirable behaviors .
        

## Skills Taught Using Video Schedules

The paper highlights several skills that were taught using video activity schedules, particularly focusing on autistic individuals. Here are the key skills mentioned:

- **Daily Living Skills (DLS):**
    
    - The primary focus of the studies reviewed was on teaching daily living skills to autistic individuals. These skills are essential for independent living and include tasks such as personal hygiene, cooking, and other routine activities .
        
- **Vocational Skills:**
    
    - Some studies also targeted vocational skills, which are crucial for employment and job-related tasks. These skills help prepare autistic individuals for the workforce .
        
- **Academic Skills:**
    
    - Video activity schedules were used to teach academic skills, particularly in a general education classroom setting. This includes tasks related to academic instruction, where students are more likely to be engaged and on task .
        
- **Leisure/Play Skills:**
    
    - Although not extensively covered, the paper suggests that there is potential for teaching leisure and play skills using video activity schedules. This area is identified as needing further research .
        

## Specific Daily Living Skills Taught Using Video Schedules
