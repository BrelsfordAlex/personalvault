# Notes
## Introduction

- Rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) necessitates research on educational supports.
    
- High-functioning adolescents with ASD are increasingly graduating high school and pursuing further education.
    
- Previous publications focused on postsecondary options for youth with ASD, often including those with intellectual disabilities.
    
- Comprehensive guidelines from empirical literature could aid decision-making for families and youth.
    
- This literature review aims to explore college pathways for high-functioning young adults with ASD.
    
- "High functioning" refers to individuals with average-to-above-average IQs who complete high school.
    
- The review will differentiate between 2- and 4-year universities, emphasizing necessary supports.
    
- Life skills and employment options for adults with ASD are acknowledged but not the focus here.
    

## Method

- Publications on postsecondary education for students with ASD were sourced from various databases.
    
- Inclusion criteria focused on empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals.
    
- Twelve data-based studies were summarized, with half utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2).
    
- Studies were categorized into post-high school transition outcomes and needs/accommodations.
    
- The review expanded to include college decision-making, accommodations, and practical/social supports.
    

## Post High School Transition and Outcomes

- Success in adulthood for individuals with ASD often requires careful planning and support.
    
- NLTS2 study revealed postsecondary outcomes: 12% attended 4-year colleges, 28% 2-year colleges.
    
- Significant predictors for college participation include high school type and academic performance.
    
- Family support is crucial for pursuing education beyond high school.
    
- Transition planning for students with ASD is often inadequate, with low self-involvement in planning.
    
- Many students with ASD may not be identified as needing postsecondary services.
    
- Transition planning should prioritize college education decisions similar to typically developing peers.
    

## Needs and Accommodations

- Research emphasizes the need for postsecondary supports for students with ASD.
    
- High-functioning students with ASD require social and organizational supports rather than curriculum modifications.
    
- Inclusive educational experiences are essential for social belonging and skill development.
    
- Practical skills and living accommodations are critical for success in college.
    
- Many supports available in K-12 education may not continue into college.
    

## The College Decision

- Choosing the right college is crucial for postsecondary success for students with ASD.
    
- A comparison of 2- and 4-year institutions highlights benefits and drawbacks of each.
    
- Smaller colleges may be less overwhelming, while larger ones offer diverse opportunities.
    
- Resources like ThinkCollege.net help identify supportive college programs for students with disabilities.
    
- Programs like the Beyond Access Program provide additional support for students with ASD.
    

## College and University Accommodations

- Research on appropriate accommodations for college-bound youths with ASD is limited.
    
- Disability policies protect students with disabilities, ensuring access to necessary supports.
    
- Universities must address the unique social and organizational difficulties faced by students with ASD.
    
- Accommodations should focus on both academic and social needs for high-functioning students.
    

## Practical and Social Supports

- Reporting ASD is important for accessing college supports, but many do not disclose their disability.
    
- Self-advocacy is crucial for students to obtain necessary accommodations.
    
- Social skills and understanding social cues are significant challenges for students with ASD.
    
- Faculty support and collaboration with disability services are vital for student success.
    

## Discussion and Future Implications

- There is a lack of empirical research on supports for college students with ASD.
    
- More research is needed to develop effective programs and support systems.
    
- Changes in diagnostic criteria may impact eligibility for services and supports.
    
- Faculty awareness and understanding of ASD can improve academic and social outcomes for students.
    

## Conclusion

- Limited research exists on college experiences of individuals with ASD.
    
- Training for faculty on supporting students with ASD is scarce.
    
- Understanding the unique challenges faced by high-functioning individuals with ASD is essential as enrollment increases.
    

## Specific Supports Enhancing College Success for Students with ASD

- **Self-Advocacy and Disability Reporting**: Students with ASD must advocate for themselves by contacting the disability office, explaining their disability, and requesting necessary accommodations. Reporting ASD is crucial for accessing supports, although many students choose not to disclose their disability due to concerns about stigmatization .
    
- **Classroom Accommodations**: Specific supports include allowing students with ASD to choose their seating to minimize sensory discomfort, providing exam accommodations like extra time or a private room, and offering note-taking assistance through laptops or recorded lectures .
    
- **Organizational Supports**: Tools such as color-coded binders, maintaining a calendar, and setting audible alarms can help students with ASD manage their time and tasks more effectively .
    
- **Faculty Engagement and Support**: Faculty play a crucial role by following predictable routines, reminding students of assignments, breaking large tasks into smaller units, and using visuals to aid understanding. Recognizing and reinforcing positive behaviors can also support students' success .
    
- **Collaboration with Disability Services**: It is essential for campus disability services to work closely with faculty to ensure students with ASD receive appropriate support, as failure to do so may lead to non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
    
- **Social and Behavioral Supports**: Providing social-behavioral supports can help students with ASD become more socially successful in college. This includes addressing maladaptive behaviors and promoting peer acceptance .
    
- **Educational and Faculty Supports**: Emphasizing the role of educational and faculty supports is crucial, as this area has received little research attention. Faculty can aid students by using their interests to motivate them and ensuring they understand instructions by having them repeat directions back .
    

## Effective Organizational Tools for Students with ASD

- **Color-Coded Binders and Folders**: Using color-coded binders and folders by subject can help students with ASD organize their materials and quickly locate what they need for each class. This visual organization method simplifies the process of managing multiple subjects and assignments .
    
- **Calendars and Organizers**: Maintaining a calendar or organizer is crucial for tracking deadlines, appointments, and class schedules. This tool helps students plan their time effectively and ensures they do not miss important dates or tasks .
    
- **Audible Alarms and Reminders**: Setting audible alarms as reminders for tasks and appointments can assist students in managing their time and staying on track with their daily activities. This tool is particularly useful for students who may struggle with time management and need prompts to transition between tasks .
    

## Teaching Methods for Supporting Students with ASD

- **Predictable Routines**: Faculty are encouraged to follow predictable routines in class. This helps students with ASD anticipate what will happen next, reducing anxiety and aiding in their ability to focus and learn effectively .
    
- **Breaking Down Assignments**: Large assignments should be broken into smaller, more manageable units. This method allows students to tackle tasks step-by-step, making it easier for them to organize their work and meet deadlines .
    
- **Use of Visuals**: Incorporating visuals, such as written instructions paired with graphics, can enhance understanding and retention of information. Visual aids support students in processing information more effectively .
    
- **Providing Ample Response Time**: Allowing students extra time to respond to questions gives them the opportunity to process information and organize their thoughts, which is crucial for effective learning .
    
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Faculty can reinforce positive behaviors, such as speaking up in class or making eye contact, by providing brief acknowledgments or quick emails. This reinforcement encourages students to engage more actively in class .
    
- **Repetition of Directions**: Asking students to repeat directions back in their own words ensures they have understood the instructions and can help them retain the information better .
