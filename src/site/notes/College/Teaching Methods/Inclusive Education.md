> [!abstract] What is Inclusive Education
> ==**Inclusive Education**== is an education system that includes all students, and strives to support them in their learning process no matter who they are or their abilities. This could mean making sure that teaching and the curriculum, school buildings, classrooms, play areas, transport and toilets are appropriate for all children at all levels.
 >   It means all children learn together in the same schools and there are ways to support all students to put them all on the same playing field
> >[!note]-  The basics of Inclusive Education
> >* **Having a high expectation for what students can do**
 > >	* Teachers should have an expectation for all students on how they should act rather than how they shouldn't act 
>  >		* for example setting the expectation that students will keep the classroom clean and students will pay attention and try their best
> >* **Individualized Support**
 > >	* Each student has the needed supports to give everyone an equitable playing field for learning and to show each students thinking and learning process
>  >* **Instructional Based Learning**
> >	* Instructional based learning is creating alternate ways of learning the curriculum which can allow all students to do assignments in ways they will succeed the most with
 > >		* **Examples:** an assignment that allows for a creative way to do it, a writing based, and maybe a verbal based way of showing understanding. > > >			* Having these ways of doing the assignment allow for students to excel in the way that they do best
