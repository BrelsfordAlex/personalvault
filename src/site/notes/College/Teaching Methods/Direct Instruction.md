>  Direct Instruction is the atypical instruction you would think a teacher should be teaching. The teaching standing in front of the classroom, giving guided instructions to the students who are sitting paying attention. 
> Some things are best learned in this way, such as some Science topics and some Math topics
> > >[!note] The Principles of Direct Instruction

>> - Despite its effectiveness, DI is not commonly used in behavior analytic services for learners with ASD, possibly due to unfamiliarity among practitioners. This contrasts with other methods that might be more widely adopted due to their inclusion in standard curricula or more frequent coverage in mainstream journals.
>> - DI emphasizes immediate feedback, providing praise for correct responses and error correction for incorrect ones. This immediate feedback loop is a distinctive feature that may not be as emphasized in other instructional methods, which might rely more on delayed feedback or self-assessment.
>> - DI is characterized by its highly structured and scripted lessons, which ensure consistent delivery across different implementers. This contrasts with other methods that may allow for more flexibility and variability in teaching styles and lesson delivery.
>> - DI has recently met criteria for consideration as an evidence-based practice for learners with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This recognition is important for encouraging its wider use in various contexts, particularly in behavior analytic services. Other methods may not have the same level of evidence-based recognition, especially in specific contexts like ASD.
> ## Limitations of Direct Instruction for Children with ASD
> - **Conservative Assessment of Study Quality**: The review highlights that the dichotomous reporting of "met" or "not met" with respect to CEC standards may lead to an overly conservative assessment of study quality. This could potentially overlook nuanced aspects of the studies that partially meet the criteria .
> - **Interpretation Variability**: There is a possibility that future reviewers might interpret the reported features differently, leading to varied conclusions regarding the quality of studies on DI. This variability in interpretation can affect the perceived effectiveness and applicability of DI for children with ASD.
> - **Limited Scope of Included Programs**: The review only included "established" DI programs listed on the NIFDI website, which may limit the findings. Future reviews might consider a broader scope, incorporating studies that use instructional design steps and teaching procedures based on DI with new curricula or materials 
> - **Lack of Familiarity Among Practitioners**: DI is not commonly included in behavior analytic services for learners with ASD, partly due to the unfamiliarity of behavior analysts with the research evaluating DI's efficacy. This lack of familiarity can hinder the adoption of DI in clinical practice.
> - **Absence from Key Educational Resources**: DI is not listed on the Behavior Analysis Certification Board's 5th edition Task List, which influences the curriculum in master's level programs. Additionally, DI articles are not frequently published in mainstream behavior analytic journals, suggesting a need for more in-depth continuing education for behavior analysts .
> - **Resource and Training Barriers**: The adoption of DI is challenged by the time and resources required to train implementers on new procedures. The lack of detailed information on treatment dosage, such as session duration and frequency, further complicates implementation .
These limitations highlight the challenges in adopting DI for children with ASD, emphasizing the need for broader research, increased practitioner education, and more comprehensive training resources.
