# **How Do I want it to look**
# **Justification Paper:**
## **Introduction**
**Thesis:** Effective teaching methods tailored for autistic students, such as the use of visual supports and structured routines, can significantly enhance engagement and understanding, thereby creating a more inclusive educational environment that benefits all learners.
**Teaching Methods Focused on:**
- [[College/Capstone/Sources with Notes/Articles/Teaching Models/3 factor method/A Three-Factor Model of Educational Practice Considerations for Teaching Neurodiverse Learners\|Three Factor Model]]
- [[College/Capstone/Sources with Notes/Articles/Teaching Models/Active Response/Training Teachers to Implement Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching during  Small group Instruction_ A Pilot Study\|Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT)]]
- [[College/Capstone/Sources with Notes/Articles/Teaching Models/Direct Instruction/A Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal of Applications of Direct Instruction with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder\|Direct Instruction]]

- **Inclusion and UDL**
**Definitions that are important for my project:**
- [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Universal Design\|Universal Design]]
	- Definition: 
- Inclusion
	- **Definition:** Inclusion for my project is being defined as Integrating as many or all students and supporting their needs into my classroom by offering supports and needs based on each student.
		- Reason for the Definition: "the term ‘inclusive’ is used broadly in education and has many meanings. It is an educational concept that has defied precise definition. Although there is a broad consensus and understanding that [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Inclusive Education\|Inclusive Education]] is ‘a process of increasing participation and decreasing exclusion from the culture, community and curricula of mainstream schools’"
			- Florian, Lani, and Kristine Black-Hawkins. “[[College/Capstone/Sources with Notes/Articles/Teaching Models/Universal Design and Inclusive Education/Exploring inclusive pedagogy\|Exploring inclusive pedagogy]].” _British Educational Research Journal_, vol. 37, no. 5, Oct. 2011, pp. 813–828, bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01411926.2010.501096, https://doi.org/10.1080/01411926.2010.501096 ([[College/Capstone/Sources with Notes/Articles/Teaching Models/Universal Design and Inclusive Education/Exploring inclusive pedagogy\|Exploring inclusive pedagogy]])
**Why I made the Project:** I made this project because I want to help students that could be struggling and having a select number of teaching methods I can go back to look at with research backing them and how they benefit students with autism.  I want to have as many teaching methods and have an understanding of them under my boot as many as possible
### About Autism in school
- Transition to: 
- How autism Presents in students 
- - Teachers perspective on autistic students 
	- quote
		-  Explanation of quote 
	- What teachers knows

			-  Explanation of quote 
	- what they dont know
		- quote
			-  Explanation of quote 
	- how they try to help
		- quote
			-  Explanation of quote 
- Transition out: Using this information I went onto looking into some teaching methods that would help with how these teachers said they struggle with their autistic students and went looking for some teaching methods that would alleviate some of these issues. 


## Body



### The Goal of this Project
- Transition to: Some Teaching methods I have found include a Three factor model, [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Direct Instruction\|Direct Instruction]], Visual aids/technology help, [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Universal Design\|Universal Design]]/Inclusion, and even scaffolding. 
- give teachers many teaching methods to use and adapt
- provide ways one could adapt the teaching methods
- create an easy template for me personally so i could update this as I learn about more methods and give myself the resources for them
- Transition out
###  All the points my project makes 
- Transition to: 
- Some teaching methods work better for certain students than others

- Teaching methods can be adapted to even non-Autistic students
