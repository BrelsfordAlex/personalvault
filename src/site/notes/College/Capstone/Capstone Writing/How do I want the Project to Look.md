I want to have a page for each teaching method and have the pages be formatted like this 
![Pasted image 20250321205321.png](/img/user/College/Capstone/PDFs%20and%20Images%20and%20Stuff/Pasted%20image%2020250321205321.png)
linking any videos or maybe online resources for the teaching methods so people can research more and at the bottom have it link to the pages for the research [[z Templates/Capstone Templates/z Templates/Articles\|Articles]]
