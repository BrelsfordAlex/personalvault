>[!info] About Visual Hybrid and Video Modeling Teaching Strategies
> Video modeling is an evidence-based practice that involves demonstrating a desired behavior or skill through video. It is frequently used for skill acquisition in autistic individuals.  Visual supports are another evidence-based practice based on the principles of behavior analysis. They are used to help autistic individuals acquire new skills by providing visual cues and aids.
> 
> Video modeling helps learners focus on relevant stimuli for task completion. Things like a video to help a student learn how to tie their shoes, or even visual aids in a classroom to help remind a student how to work through math problems or what a verb is.  Visual aids can help with Routine as well, which is important for autistic students. 
> 
> Visual supports enhance understanding of routines and expected behaviors across various skills. Digital activity schedules improve engagement and independence, offering advantages over traditional methods. Meaning, if students had access to the schedule in some way, they could look at it and remind themselves of what's going to happen next which could alleviate some stress with switching classes.
>> [!NOTE]
> > Specific daily living skills that were targeted using video activity schedules for autistic individuals. These skills are essential for fostering independence and include:
> > - **Laundry:**
> >     
> >     - Participants were taught how to do laundry, which involves sorting clothes, using a washing machine, and drying clothes .
> >         
> > - **Meal Preparation and Cooking:**
> >     
> >     - Skills related to preparing or cooking a meal or snack were targeted. This includes understanding recipes, measuring ingredients, and using kitchen appliances safely .
> >         
> > - **Cleaning:**
> >     
> >     - Cleaning tasks such as sweeping floors and washing dishes were part of the daily living skills taught. These tasks help maintain a clean and organized living environment .
> >         
> > - **Table Setting:**
> >     
> >     - Participants learned how to set the table for a meal, which involves arranging utensils, plates, and glasses appropriately .
> >         
> > - **Tying Shoes:**
> >    - The skill of tying shoes was also included, which is a fundamental daily living skill for personal care and dressing .
> Even though these skills are not classroom related, we can assume this teaching style would work similarly for classroom material.

> > [!NOTE]- Understanding the Visual Hybrid Development Learning System (VHDLS)
> > 
> > The Visual Hybrid Development Learning System (VHDLS) is a framework designed to assist in the development of educational software specifically tailored for children with autism. Here are the key aspects of the VHDLS framework:
> > 
> > - **Purpose and Objective**: The primary goal of the VHDLS framework is to help software developers create learning systems that can effectively capture and maintain the attention of children with autism. This is crucial because children with autism often have attention deficits, which can hinder their learning and overall quality of life .
> >     
> > - **Framework Components**: The VHDLS framework is based on an instructional design model that includes four basic components: learners, objectives, methods, and evaluation. These components are designed to address the personality, ability, and preferences of the learner, as well as the content and method of the learning objectives .
> >     
> > - **Visual Themes and Styles**: The framework incorporates different visual themes identified during preliminary studies. These themes include representational styles such as humanoid animation, transitional images, and videos, as well as decorative styles like abstract animation. These visual elements are intended to engage children with autism by catering to their visual learning preferences .
> >     
> > - **Implementation**: The VHDLS framework has been implemented in a computer-based learning system called VHLQ. This system allows trainers to select visual styles and repetition options based on the learner's preferences, thereby personalizing the learning experience to better suit the needs of children with autism .
> >     
> > - **Experimental Study**: An experimental study of the VHLQ learning system, based on the VHDLS framework, demonstrated its effectiveness in gaining and maintaining the attention of children with autism. The study involved participants with low attention spans and showed positive results in increasing their attention during learning tasks .
> >     
> > 
> > Overall, the VHDLS framework is a comprehensive approach to developing educational tools that cater to the unique learning needs of children with autism, emphasizing visual engagement and personalized learning experiences.
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > ## Most Effective Visual Themes in VHDLS
> > 
> > The Visual Hybrid Development Learning System (VHDLS) framework incorporates various visual themes to enhance the learning experience for children with autism. The effectiveness of these themes was evaluated in the study, and the following insights were gathered:
> > 
> > - **Visual Hybrid Style**: The study found that the visual hybrid style, which combines representational and decorative elements, was more effective in increasing the attention span of participants compared to using representational styles alone. This hybrid approach includes humanoid cartoons, transitional images, videos, and abstract visuals, which together create a more engaging learning environment for children with autism .
> >     
> > - **Satisfaction Levels**: Participants expressed higher satisfaction with the visual hybrid style compared to the representational style alone. This suggests that the combination of decorative elements with representational visuals not only captures attention but also enhances the overall learning experience and satisfaction for children with autism .
> >     
> > - **Representational Styles**: Within the representational styles, video modelling was highlighted as a significant component. It facilitates comprehension by providing real scenarios that cater to the selective attention needs of children with autism. This approach helps in illustrating content effectively, although it may not represent the entire information but rather parts that can convey the whole concept .
> >     
> > - **Decorative Elements**: The use of abstract visuals as decorative elements aims to provide visual awareness and a playful session with minimal messaging. This approach is intended to stimulate interest and engagement without overwhelming the cognitive load of the learners .
