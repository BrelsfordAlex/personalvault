> > >[!note]  The Principles of the Three Factor Method
> > > - Factor One: Educators must familiarize themselves with the evolving neurodiversity scholarship. This involves understanding the latest research and theoretical frameworks related to neurodiversity.  (Sewell and Park)
> >> - Factor Two: Teachers need to align this research knowledge with individual assessment data gathered from a strengths-based perspective. This means integrating insights from strengths-based assessments to better understand each learner's unique profile.  (Sewell and Park)
> >> - Factor Three: The final step involves translating this knowledge into contextualized teaching strategies. This requires teachers to consider both individual and contextual strengths when developing interventions.  (Sewell and Park)

>>[!todo]-  Understanding the Three-Factor Model 
>>The three-factor model is a framework designed to guide teachers in effectively educating neurodiverse learners by integrating various critical elements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the model:
>>
>>- Factor One: Knowledge of Research Literature
>>	- Teachers need to be well-versed in the latest research on neurodiversity and strengths-based assessment approaches. This involves understanding the nascent but rapidly developing literature in these areas, which provides a foundation for informed teaching practices .  (Sewell and Park)
>>
>>- Factor Two: Alignment with Individual Assessments
>>	- This factor emphasizes the importance of aligning research knowledge with individual assessments of students. Teachers should use strengths-based assessment frameworks, like the Context of Strengths Finder (CSF), to gather data on each student's unique strengths and challenges. This alignment helps in developing personalized educational interventions .  (Sewell and Park)
>>
>>- Factor Three: Consideration of Contextual Factors
>>	- The third factor involves considering the contextual factors from both school and home environments. Teachers are encouraged to use these contextual insights to inform and tailor their educational interventions, ensuring they are relevant and effective for each learner. This factor is often overlooked but is crucial for creating meaningful and evidence-informed educational strategies.  (Sewell and Park)  
>>
>>The model is positioned as a practice-oriented framework that seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world teaching practices. It focuses on the "how" of implementing neurodiverse, strengths-based educational practices, rather than just the "what". By using this model, teachers can develop contextually relevant learning interventions for learners with neurodevelopmental differences, as demonstrated through hypothetical case examples in the paper.  (Sewell and Park)
>>
>>Such case examples illustrate the practical application of the model, showcasing how tailored strategies can lead to improved educational outcomes and foster a more inclusive learning environment.  (Sewell and Park)

>> [!todo]- How the Three-Factor Model Supports Autistic Students
>> 
>> The three-factor model proposed in the paper is designed to help teachers effectively support autistic students by integrating research, assessment, and contextual factors. Here's how each factor contributes:
>> 
>> - Factor One: Knowledge of Neurodiverse Research Literature
>> 	- Teachers are encouraged to understand the latest research on neurodiversity, which includes recognizing traits like hyper-systemizing and intense interests as strengths rather than deficits. This understanding allows teachers to appreciate the cognitive styles of autistic students, such as their excellent attention to detail and pattern recognition abilities, which can be leveraged in learning activities.  (Sewell and Park)
>> 
>> - Factor Two: Aligning Assessment with Understanding of the Child
>> 	- The model emphasizes the use of strengths-based assessment frameworks, like the Context of Strengths Finder (CSF), to gather individual assessment data. This approach helps teachers develop a contextualized understanding of each autistic student's unique strengths, moving away from deficit-based models. By focusing on strengths, teachers can tailor educational interventions that align with the student's abilities and interests.  (Sewell and Park)
>> 
>> - Factor Three: Considering Contextual Factors for Intervention
>> 	- Teachers are encouraged to consider school and home-based contextual factors when designing interventions. For example, creating inclusive strategies such as providing quiet spaces for concentration can help autistic students manage sensory sensitivities and focus better. This factor ensures that interventions are not only evidence-informed, but also practically applicable within the student's environment.  (Sewell and Park)
>> 
>> Overall, the three-factor model helps teachers create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for autistic students by integrating research, personalized assessment, and contextual considerations into their teaching strategies. This approach not only addresses the educational needs of autistic students but also fosters their strengths and potential
