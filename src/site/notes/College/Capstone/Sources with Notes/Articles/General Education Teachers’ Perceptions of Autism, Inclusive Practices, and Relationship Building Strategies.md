# Notes about the article

This article describes ways that general education teachers think of the students
they have that have Autism. The authors also compile that information and go into detail
ok how some teachers create inclusive classrooms. The article will be used to help find
the best ways to incorporate neurodiverse ways of inclusion into the curriculum I plan to
make.

## Introduction

- Inclusive educational placement has evolved over 45 years, benefiting students with disabilities.
    
- In 2015, 91% of autistic students in the U.S. were in general education schools.
    
- Teachers play a critical role in facilitating inclusion practices for students with disabilities.
    
- Despite benefits, the adoption of inclusive practices by teachers has been slow.
    
- General education teachers often do not employ effective inclusion strategies.
    
- Teachers' perceptions of disabilities significantly influence their willingness to accommodate students.
    
- Negative perceptions can hinder teachers' confidence in integrating students with disabilities.
    
- Teachers' experiences and training shape their views on autism and inclusion.
    
- Understanding teachers' perceptions is crucial for supporting [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Inclusive Education\|Inclusive Education]].
    
- The study aims to explore teachers' perceptions of ASD and their inclusive practices.
    

## Autistic Students in Inclusive Classrooms

- Autistic students in general education often show strengths in intellectual functioning and communication.
    
- ASD characteristics can create challenges for teachers in inclusive settings.
    
- Autistic students are prone to emotional and behavioral difficulties, increasing teacher stress.
    
- Teachers report behavioral issues as the greatest challenge in teaching autistic students.
    
- Inclusion can be daunting for teachers without adequate support or training.
    
- Autistic students often have poor relationships with teachers, affecting their school experience.
    
- Positive student-teacher relationships can enhance social acceptance and inclusion.
    
- Low teaching efficacy among teachers is linked to insufficient training in ASD.
    
- Many teachers feel unprepared to teach and interact positively with autistic students.
    
- Professional development in ASD can improve teachers' knowledge and attitudes.
    

## Purpose of Present Study

- The study aims to understand teachers' perceptions of ASD and their inclusion strategies.
    
- It is part of a larger project to develop professional development programs for teachers.
    
- Focus groups were conducted to gather insights on teachers' views and strategies.
    
- It was hypothesized that teachers would have negative opinions about autistic students.
    
- Findings will inform the development of the professional development program.
    

## Participants

- General education teachers from Southern California and Massachusetts participated in focus groups.
    
- Eligible teachers had experience teaching autistic students in early elementary grades.
    
- Focus groups were conducted outside school hours, with consent obtained from participants.
    
- A total of 18 teachers participated, primarily female, with diverse racial backgrounds.
    
- Teachers had an average of 14.9 years of teaching experience.
    
- All participants taught in public schools, with some having prior autism training.
    

## Focus Group Design

- The study received institutional review board approval for its procedures.
    
- Three prompts were used to elicit teachers' perspectives on autism and inclusion.
    
- The focus group process included free-listing, ranking, and explaining responses.
    
- Teachers wrote down their thoughts anonymously, which were then categorized and discussed.
    
- Focus groups were recorded and transcribed for analysis.
    

## Analyses

- Qualitative analysis involved coding responses into categories based on similarities.
    
- Categories were created to maintain the accuracy of individual responses.
    
- Saliency scores were calculated to determine the prominence of each response category.
    
- The analysis aimed to highlight the most important themes from teachers' responses.
    

## Results

- The results highlight the five most salient categories for each focus group prompt.
    
- Saliency scores and illustrative quotes accompany each category.
    

## Teacher Perceptions of Autistic Students

- Teachers generated diverse responses about their impressions of autistic students.
    
- Descriptions were centered on observable behaviors rather than predominantly negative or positive.
    
- Teachers demonstrated a good understanding of ASD characteristics.
    
- Common themes included social disconnect and difficulties with interactions.
    
- Teachers' awareness of autism-related behaviors suggests a need for further training.
    
- Effective strategies like social narratives can support autistic students' understanding.
    

## What Inclusive Strategies were Endorsed by General Education Teachers?

- Teachers reported strategies to enhance success for autistic students in inclusive settings.
    
- Assigning special jobs was a highly endorsed strategy for promoting inclusion.
    
- Visual tools, routines, and consistent language were emphasized for effective teaching.
    
- Classroom environment considerations were noted but had lower saliency.
    
- Strategies for family collaboration were less emphasized, indicating a potential gap.
    
- Positive reinforcement and showcasing student strengths were also highlighted as effective.
    

## How did General Education Teachers Promote Positive Relationships with Their Autistic Students?

- Teachers endorsed strategies for building positive relationships with autistic students.
    
- Strategies included consistency, listening, and personalized interactions.
    
- Despite awareness, autistic students often have poorer-quality relationships with teachers.
    
- Some strategies may require adaptations to be effective for autistic students.
    
- Active listening was underutilized, despite its importance in fostering relationships.
    

## Future Directions and Limitations

- Findings can inform the development of teacher training programs for autism.
    
- Teachers' insights should guide the incorporation of effective strategies into training.
    
- Addressing barriers to implementing evidence-based practices is essential.
    
- Emphasizing the recognition of student strengths and interests is crucial.
    
- Teacher training should include behavior management strategies for challenging behaviors.
    
- Collaboration with families should be prioritized in training programs.
    
- Limitations include the regional focus and volunteer nature of participants.
    
- Teacher-generated responses provide valuable insights for future programming.
