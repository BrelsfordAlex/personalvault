# Notes
## Social Communication and Peer Interaction

- Majority of autistic individuals have average to above-average intellectual functioning.
    
- Social communication skills, including  conversation and nonverbal cues, are challenging for autistic students.
    
- Transition from physical play to verbal interaction is particularly difficult for children with autism.
    
- Social awkwardness in teens with autism can lead to isolation and depression.
    
- Social learning theory suggests children with autism need structured prompts for effective learning.
    
- Social stories are a popular intervention, describing social situations and expected responses.
    
- These stories are tailored to individual needs and can be read or viewed by the child.
    

## Treatments within Natural Environments

- Ecobehavioral approaches focus on behavioral strategies in natural settings.
    
- An ecobehavioral study showed teaching sign language reduced maladaptive behaviors in a child with autism.
    
- The effectiveness of ecologically based interventions remains underexplored.
    

## Evidenced-Based Treatments

- Research indicates social stories can effectively teach social/communication skills to children with developmental disorders.
    
- The National Autism Center categorized social stories as an established treatment for ages six to fourteen.
    
- ASAT questioned the evidence base but acknowledged effectiveness under certain conditions.
    
- More controlled studies are needed to clarify variables influencing behavior change.
    
- Current research targets various teaching strategies for children with different levels of ASD.
    
- Social stories have been used to improve peer interactions and social skills in various settings.
    
- Generalization of social skills learned through social stories remains a challenge.
    

## Participants

- Four middle school students with autism participated, receiving academic instruction in general education settings.
    
- Parental consent was obtained, and peer helpers were trained for confidentiality and voluntary participation.
    
- Participants included Andrew, Jake, Karen, and Cam, with varying cognitive functioning levels.
    

## Settings

- The study took place in a public middle school in rural East Texas.
    
- Classrooms and lunchrooms provided natural settings for social skill acquisition.
    
- Participants engaged in social interactions during lunch and passing periods.
    

## Dependent Variable

- Appropriate greeting responses included verbal/nonverbal greetings and facial orientation towards the peer helper.
    
- Acceptable responses required eye contact or looking at the peer helper.
    

## Intervention Criteria

- Intervention completion required participants to demonstrate target behaviors in four out of four probes over three consecutive days.
    

## Generalization Probe

- Generalization trials occurred in settings outside the classroom, such as passing periods and lunchrooms.
    
- Peer helpers were selected based on social skills and role model potential.
    

## Data Collection

- Greeting responses were recorded through event-recording during various phases of the study.
    
- Observations were conducted by trained staff, ensuring accurate data collection.
    
- Weekly probes assessed generalization of greeting responses in different settings.
    

## Interobserver Agreement

- IOA was calculated to ensure reliability of observations, achieving approximately 96% agreement.
    
- Fidelity checks verified participants viewed the required videos during intervention phases.
    

## Materials and Implementation of Treatment

- Participants viewed a video-modeled social story daily, demonstrating desired social behaviors.
    

## Social Story Title: How to Greet Someone

- The social story outlined various ways to greet someone, emphasizing friendly interactions.
    
- It included examples of verbal greetings and nonverbal gestures like handshakes and smiles.
    

## Pre-training the Peer Helpers

- Peer helpers received training on proper greeting techniques before the intervention began.
    
- Baseline conditions were established to assess participants' initial greeting responses.
    

## Procedures

- Teachers provided instructions on accessing and viewing the social story video in class.
    
- The intervention aimed for a 50% increase in greeting responses over baseline data.
    

## Follow-Up Procedures

- A two-week follow-up assessed the sustainability of greeting responses without intervention.
    

## Results

- Participants showed significant improvements in greeting responses during the intervention phase.
    
- Each participant demonstrated increased social responsiveness, with varying levels of success.
    
- Follow-up observations indicated sustained improvements in greeting behaviors.
    

## Figure 1. Participants' Greeting Responses to Peer Helpers in the Classroom

- Data illustrated participants' greeting responses across different settings and phases.
    
- Generalization of skills was observed in lunchroom and passing period contexts.
    

## Discussion

- The study confirmed the effectiveness of social stories in improving social skills.
    
- The ecobehavioral approach minimized disruption to academic routines.
    
- Follow-up conditions showed sustained prosocial behavior without ongoing intervention.
    
- Limitations included variability in attendance and the need for structured observation schedules.
    

## Indirect Evidence and Social Feedback

- Participants exhibited additional prosocial behaviors beyond targeted greeting responses.
    
- Improvements included initiating greetings with staff and peers outside the study context.
    

## Recommendations for Future Studies

- Future research should involve more participants and extended intervention durations.
    
- Studies should assess the durability of social skills across various settings and conditions.
    
- Exploring the impact of participant characteristics on intervention effectiveness is suggested.
    

## Selection and Training of Peer Helpers

- **Selection of Peer Helpers**: Peer helpers were assigned to each participant based on mutual enrollment in two specific classes. This arrangement was intended to facilitate natural interactions and possibly indirect practice between participants and peer helpers .
    
- **Training of Peer Helpers**: A large group peer helper training session was conducted before the intervention began. During this session, the lead researcher trained the peer helpers on the proper verbal intonation and gestural topography to use when making spontaneous social greetings to participants .
    
- **Prompting Techniques**: Peer helpers were either visually or verbally prompted to greet participants. This involved walking up to participants, visually acknowledging them by orienting their faces towards the participants, and verbally greeting them. These prompts were given by a participating teacher, the lead researcher, or a doctoral intern .
    

## Teaching Methods Used in the Study

- **Social Stories**: The study utilized social stories as a primary teaching method. These stories describe social situations, skills, or concepts in terms of relevant social cues, perspectives, and common responses. They are tailored to address specific deficiencies in individuals' social repertoires and can be read or viewed by the individuals for whom they are designed .
    
- **Video Modeling**: An intervention was presented via video, which involved a reduction of stress on teaching staff and was implemented within the participants' natural school settings with limited disruption to routine. This suggests that video modeling was a practical tool used in the study .
    
- **Role-Playing**: Data collection training for teachers and staff included role-playing various scenarios that might occur during the experiment. This method was used to ensure that the teachers and staff were well-prepared to handle different situations during the study .
    
- **Visual and Written Cues**: The treatment package included pictorial and written cues, which were part of the instruction sessions. These cues were used to detail social interactions and were likely intended to reinforce the learning of social skills .
    
- **Self-Evaluation with Video Feedback**: After social interaction practice, participants engaged in self-evaluation using video feedback. This method allowed participants to observe and assess their own behaviors, which could help in reinforcing the learning of targeted social skills .
    
- **Narration and Puppetry**: In a distinctive approach, the study included a narration of dialogue using two puppets and a self-modeled video of the participant acting out behaviors provided within the social story. This method was used to teach social skills to a young child with autism .
