## Methods Used in the Paper

The paper employs a three-factor model to address the educational practices for teaching neurodiverse learners. Here are the key methods outlined:

- Three-Factor Model Development: The authors propose a three-factor model that includes:
	- Factor One: Educators must familiarize themselves with the evolving neurodiversity scholarship. This involves understanding the latest research and theoretical frameworks related to neurodiversity .  (Sewell and Park)
	- Factor Two: Teachers need to align this research knowledge with individual assessment data gathered from a strengths-based perspective. This means integrating insights from strengths-based assessments to better understand each learner's unique profile .  (Sewell and Park)
	- Factor Three: The final step involves translating this knowledge into contextualized teaching strategies. This requires teachers to consider both individual and contextual strengths when developing interventions .  (Sewell and Park)

- Case Examples: The paper includes two hypothetical case examples focusing on learners with Autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These cases are composites based on the authors' experiences as Educational Psychologists, illustrating how the three-factor model can be applied in real-world settings .  (Sewell and Park)
    
- Context of Strengths Finder (CSF): The authors utilize the CSF as a framework for strengths-based assessment. This approach emphasizes a systemic consideration of contextual factors, such as home and school environments, which can influence a learner's strengths and needs .  (Sewell and Park)
    
- Evidence-Informed Practice: The model is designed to align with existing notions of evidence-informed practice. It encourages teachers to engage with a broad range of evidence, including research outcomes and contextual data, to inform their teaching strategies .  (Sewell and Park)
    
- Focus on Practical Application: The paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical teaching methods, emphasizing the 'how' of implementing strengths-based educational practices for neurodiverse learners .  (Sewell and Park)
    

These methods collectively aim to enhance the educational experiences of neurodiverse learners by promoting a strengths-based, evidence-informed approach to teaching.

This approach not only fosters an inclusive learning environment but also empowers educators to tailor their strategies, ensuring that each learner's unique abilities are recognized and nurtured.

## Understanding the Three-Factor Model

The three-factor model is a framework designed to guide teachers in effectively educating neurodiverse learners by integrating various critical elements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the model:

- Factor One: Knowledge of Research Literature
	- Teachers need to be well-versed in the latest research on neurodiversity and strengths-based assessment approaches. This involves understanding the nascent but rapidly developing literature in these areas, which provides a foundation for informed teaching practices .  (Sewell and Park)

- Factor Two: Alignment with Individual Assessments
	- This factor emphasizes the importance of aligning research knowledge with individual assessments of students. Teachers should use strengths-based assessment frameworks, like the Context of Strengths Finder (CSF), to gather data on each student's unique strengths and challenges. This alignment helps in developing personalized educational interventions .  (Sewell and Park)

- Factor Three: Consideration of Contextual Factors
	- The third factor involves considering the contextual factors from both school and home environments. Teachers are encouraged to use these contextual insights to inform and tailor their educational interventions, ensuring they are relevant and effective for each learner. This factor is often overlooked but is crucial for creating meaningful and evidence-informed educational strategies .  (Sewell and Park)
    

The model is positioned as a practice-oriented framework that seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world teaching practices. It focuses on the "how" of implementing neurodiverse, strengths-based educational practices, rather than just the "what" . By using this model, teachers can develop contextually relevant learning interventions for learners with neurodevelopmental differences, as demonstrated through hypothetical case examples in the paper .  (Sewell and Park)

Such case examples illustrate the practical application of the model, showcasing how tailored strategies can lead to improved educational outcomes and foster a more inclusive learning environment.   (Sewell and Park)

- CSF encourages a systemic view of strengths, avoiding deficit-based approaches.
    

## Context of strengths finder

- The CSF includes 24 self-report items covering various strengths.
    
- Children rate strengths as 'definite', 'partial', or 'not a strength'.
    
- The CSF aligns individual strengths with neurodiverse abilities from research.
    
- Gender-neutral names and pronouns are used to avoid bias in case examples.
    
- There is a noted bias in diagnosing and supporting boys over girls.
