## Teaching Methods Used for Language Learning in ASD

- **Mixed Approach**: The studies primarily used a mixed approach combining correlational and grounded theory methods. This approach was used to assess the effects of acquiring scripted and unscripted verbalizations and play actions by children with ASD. Visual analysis and software were employed to analyze the data .
    
- **Quantitative Designs**: Among the quantitative studies, predictive and explanatory designs were predominant. These studies often took a basic, nonexperimental, simple descriptive, and cross-sectional approach .
    
- **Voice-Generating Devices**: In some studies, participants were grouped based on their EESA scores to make decisions about the phasing of interventions using voice-generating devices. This method aimed to elicit responses to social cues from children with and without ASD .
    
- **Augmented Reality**: In one study, augmented reality application videos were observed to analyze the level of acquired language. The data from these observations were transferred to software for further analysis .
    
- **Vocabulary Tests and Interviews**: A mixed research design was also adopted, which included quantitative data analysis through vocabulary tests to examine students' vocabulary acquisition and qualitative data through interviews with children. This approach was based on Vygotsky's sociohistorical theory .
    

## Most Effective Technologies for Language Learning in ASD

- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: These technologies were highlighted for their ability to create immersive environments that simulate reality or enhance the real world with virtual objects. They are particularly effective because they provide engaging and interactive experiences that can be tailored to the needs of students with ASD. The use of VR and AR can help in creating predictable and structured routines, which are beneficial for these students .
    
- **Video Modeling**: This method was found to be effective in replacing traditional oral or written instructions. Video modeling allows instructions to be facilitated and understood through technology, which can be more accessible for students with ASD. This approach supports better behavior and interaction in the classroom compared to traditional methods .
    
- **Digital Games**: Although research is limited, digital games have shown promise in providing individualized environments with immediate feedback. This can be particularly beneficial for practicing skills and enhancing neuropsychological assessments for children with neurocognitive disorders, including ASD. The engaging nature of digital games can help maintain the interest and motivation of students .
    
- **Computer-Based Assessments**: These assessments are gaining traction as they can aid and enhance the interpretation of standard neuropsychological assessments. They offer a structured way to evaluate and support the learning process for students with ASD, providing insights that might not be as easily obtained through traditional assessment methods .
    

## Limitations in Technology Effectiveness for ASD Language Learning

- **Study Design and Methodology**: Many studies used a mixed-method approach, with only a few employing quantitative methods. This can limit the generalizability of the results and the ability to establish causal relationships between technology use and language learning outcomes in students with ASD .
    
- **Sample Size and Participant Diversity**: The studies often involved small sample sizes, predominantly focusing on primary school students. This limitation affects the statistical power and representativeness of the findings, making it difficult to apply the results to a broader population .
    
- **Assessment Tools**: In some cases, the authors did not clearly indicate the assessment tools used or provide sufficient information about their validity and reliability. This lack of transparency can question the accuracy of the measurements and the interpretation of the data .
    
- **Geographical Distribution**: There was an unequal geographical distribution of studies, with a significant predominance in North America and China. This suggests that the findings may not be applicable to certain cultural contexts, such as those in Latin America, where fewer studies have been conducted .
    
- **Teacher Utilization of Technology**: The effectiveness of technology was found to depend significantly on how teachers use it. Some studies noted that the expected changes in students were not achieved, indicating that the impact of technology is closely linked to its implementation by educators .
    
- **Safety Concerns**: The severity of ASD characteristics means that not all technological tools are appropriate for every student. Inappropriate use can lead to decompensations, unintentional injuries, or self-flagellation among students with ASD. This highlights the need for safety training and a protected environment when using technologies like virtual reality .
    

## Key Findings on Interventions for ASD Students

- **Effectiveness of Technology**: The use of technology, such as video modeling, was found to be effective in facilitating language learning for students with ASD. It helped replace traditional oral or written instructions, making them easier to understand through technological means .
    
- **Inclusion and Interaction**: Interventions that included the whole class and promoted interaction among students with ASD showed positive outcomes. These interventions were more effective compared to traditional classroom settings, enhancing social interaction and inclusion .
    
- **Motivation and Engagement**: The incorporation of advanced technologies, like virtual reality and robots, was noted to increase motivation and engagement among ASD students. These students showed a preference for working with more advanced technological platforms over traditional methods .
    
- **Challenges in Implementation**: Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges in implementing fully immersive virtual reality systems in real-world settings. These challenges include the need for safe and controllable environments to ensure the well-being of ASD students during interventions .
    
- **Social Skills Development**: Technology-based interventions were found to improve social skills and decrease atypical behaviors, such as anger, among ASD students. This suggests that technology can play a role in enhancing interpersonal interactions and reducing behavioral issues .
    
- **Interdisciplinary Support**: Beyond the use of technology, the interventions highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary support, including psychological, informational, and educational assistance, to help ASD students integrate better into the social world .
    

## Positive Advances in Students with Autism

- **Improved Motivation and Engagement**: The use of technology in educational interventions has been shown to increase motivation and engagement among students with autism. This is particularly evident when advanced technologies, such as virtual reality and robots, are used, as they tend to capture the interest of ASD students more effectively than traditional methods .
    
- **Enhanced Social Skills**: Interventions that incorporate technology have been observed to improve social skills among students with autism. These interventions help decrease atypical behaviors, such as anger, and promote better social interactions with peers .
    
- **Increased Quality of Learning**: The integration of digital tools in the teaching-learning process has been associated with a positive impact on the quality of language learning for students with autism. This suggests that technology can enhance the educational experience and outcomes for these students .
    
- **Greater Inclusion and Interaction**: The use of technology in classrooms has facilitated greater inclusion and interaction among students with autism. By involving the whole class and promoting interaction, these interventions have been more effective than traditional classroom settings .
    
- **Positive Advances in Language Learning**: The systematic review highlighted that students with autism showed positive advances in language learning when pedagogical strategies linked to technology were incorporated. This indicates that technology can be a valuable tool in supporting language development for ASD students .
