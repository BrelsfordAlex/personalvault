## Introduction

- Increase in students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reported by educators.
    
- ASD characterized by communication, social development issues, and resistance to change.
    
- Educators face challenges in creating inclusive environments for ASD students.
    
- Many schools struggle to meet the needs of students with ASD.
    
- Teachers and parents agree on the need for better social inclusion in classrooms.
    
- Limited knowledge and training on ASD among teachers hinder effective support.
    
- A UK study found only 5% of teachers received autism training.
    
- This study aims to explore socio-structural factors affecting inclusion of ASD children.
    
- Ontario mandates special education programs for students with exceptionalities.
    
- The Ministry of Education prioritizes inclusion of ASD students in schools.
    

## Theoretical Perspective: Inclusive Education

- Inclusive social climates are essential for children's potential and self-worth.
    
- The UN Convention emphasizes dignity and community participation for all children.
    
- The study uses a model outlining essential elements of inclusion for analysis.
    

## Essential Elements of Inclusion

- The model includes visionary leadership, collaboration, assessment, support, funding, parental involvement, and curricular adaptation.
    
- These elements guide the development of [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Inclusive Education\|Inclusive Education]] programs.
    
- Implementing best practices may be challenging for teachers with high-functioning autism students.
    

## Methods

- Qualitative design used to explore educators' challenges and strategies for inclusion.
    
- Ethical approval obtained from relevant review boards.
    

## Sample

- Purposive sample of educators to understand challenges in including ASD children.
    
- Participants had at least two years of experience in integrated classrooms.
    
- Sample included 13 educators with diverse teaching backgrounds and experiences.
    

## Data Gathering

- Semi-structured interviews conducted to explore challenges faced by teachers.
    
- Informed consent obtained; demographic data collected prior to interviews.
    
- Questions focused on teaching experience, challenges, and strategies for ASD inclusion.
    

## Data Analysis

- Interviews transcribed and analyzed for emerging themes.
    
- Essential elements of inclusion informed the analysis.
    
- Constant comparative approach used to refine themes and ensure trustworthiness.
    

## Results: Challenges in Inclusion

- Key challenges include understanding behavior, socio-structural barriers, and creating inclusive environments.
    
- No patterns found related to school type or teacher experience regarding challenges.
    

## Understanding and Managing Behaviour

- Teachers struggle with managing ASD behaviors and lack adequate information.
    
- Unstructured times like recess pose additional challenges for behavior management.
    
- Establishing rapport with students is crucial but often difficult.
    

## Socio-structural Barriers

- Lack of training and resources identified as significant barriers to inclusion.
    
- Teachers advocate for consistent training and support for working with ASD students.
    
- Insufficient resources and funding for necessary equipment hinder effective teaching.
    

## Challenges in Creating an Inclusive Environment

- Lack of awareness about ASD among staff, students, and parents complicates inclusion.
    
- Teachers often take on the role of educating peers about ASD.
    

## Parental Engagement

- Engaging parents is challenging, especially when children are not formally identified.
    
- Lack of identification limits access to resources and support for ASD students.
    

## Educators' Challenges of Including Children with ASD

- Teachers manage concerns from parents of peers regarding ASD students.
    
- Balancing communication with parents of ASD children and their peers is difficult.
    

## Peer Understanding and Acceptance

- Teachers face challenges in fostering peer acceptance and understanding of ASD.
    
- Children often exclude peers with ASD due to lack of awareness and understanding.
    

## Discussion

- Study highlights the importance of social inclusion for ASD children's development.
    
- Teachers struggle to apply best practices due to lack of training and resources.
    
- Socio-structural barriers significantly impact the inclusion of ASD students.
    
- Collaboration and support from colleagues and parents are essential for success.
    

## Conclusion

- Teachers encounter multiple challenges in including ASD students in mainstream classes.
    
- More resources, training, and support are necessary for effective inclusion.
    
- Recommendations include workshops and teamwork to enhance ASD students' inclusion.
    

## Recommended Training for Inclusion of ASD Students

Teachers in the study recommend several types of training to enhance the inclusion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream classrooms:

- **Specific Training and Support**: Teachers emphasize the need for specific training and support to facilitate the full inclusion of children with ASD. This includes understanding the unique needs of these students and how to address them effectively within the classroom setting .
    
- **Workshops and Professional Development**: Continuing efforts for staff development, such as workshops or professional development sessions, are deemed necessary. These initiatives are crucial for equipping teachers with the skills and knowledge required to support ASD students effectively .
    
- **Collaboration and Understanding**: Teachers also highlight the importance of understanding and collaboration from their colleagues and the school board. This collaborative approach can help create a more inclusive environment for ASD students by ensuring that all staff members are on the same page regarding best practices for inclusion .
    

## Effective Collaboration Strategies for Inclusion

The paper highlights several collaboration strategies that are effective in promoting the inclusion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream classrooms:

- **Multi-Disciplinary Team Collaboration**: Collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team is essential for ensuring that children with ASD receive services tailored to their needs. This approach involves working with various professionals, such as special educators, therapists, and counselors, to provide comprehensive support for the students .
    
- **Teamwork Emphasis**: Schools should emphasize teamwork to address the needs of children with ASD. By fostering a collaborative environment, educators can develop effective solutions to enhance the inclusion of these students. This teamwork approach helps in sharing responsibilities and insights among teachers and staff .
    
- **Whole-School Approach**: A whole-school approach is suggested to support and guide teachers on how to best include children with ASD within their classes. This involves creating a supportive school culture where all staff members are committed to inclusive practices and disability awareness .
    
- **Collaboration and Understanding from Colleagues**: Teachers need understanding and collaboration from their colleagues and the school board. This support is crucial for facilitating the full inclusion of children with ASD, as it ensures that all educators are aligned in their efforts to create an inclusive environment .
