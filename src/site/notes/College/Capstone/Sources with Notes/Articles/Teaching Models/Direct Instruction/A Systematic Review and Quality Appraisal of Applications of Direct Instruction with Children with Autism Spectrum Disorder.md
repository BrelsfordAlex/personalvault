# Notes
## Summary of the Systematic Review on [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Direct Instruction\|Direct Instruction]] for Children with ASD

- **Objective and Background**: The paper systematically reviews the application of [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Direct Instruction\|Direct Instruction]] (DI) for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). DI, developed by Siegfried Engelmann, is a well-established teaching model but is not commonly integrated into behavior analytic services for ASD learners. This gap may be due to a lack of familiarity among behavior analysts with DI's efficacy in this context .
    
- **Research Methodology**: The review involved a comprehensive search of three databases: PsychInfo, ERIC, and NIFDI, using specific keywords related to DI and autism. The search yielded 128 studies initially, which were narrowed down to 87 after removing duplicates. The inclusion criteria required studies to be peer-reviewed, experimental, in English, and involve at least one participant with ASD, focusing on an established DI curriculum .
    
- **Findings and Quality Assessment**: The review found that no study met all the quality indicators set by the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC). However, three studies met seven out of eight indicators, suggesting some evidence for DI's efficacy with ASD learners. The review highlighted common issues such as unclear reporting on participant demographics and intervention dosage .
    
- **Barriers and Recommendations**: The paper identifies barriers to DI's adoption, such as technical jargon and insufficient details on treatment dosage in existing research. It suggests that adopting procedures successfully implemented on a wide scale in similar contexts could be beneficial, provided there is ample evidence supporting their application with ASD children .
    
- **Future Directions**: The authors emphasize the need for further research to address identified gaps and enhance DI's adoption in clinical settings. They suggest that practitioners can utilize current knowledge of DI to benefit their clients with ASD, while future research should focus on improving study quality and reporting .
    
- **Limitations**: The review acknowledges limitations, including potential biases in interpreting study quality and the focus on established DI programs. It also notes that future reviews might reach different conclusions based on the same data .
    

This summary encapsulates the paper's exploration of DI's potential for ASD learners, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of integrating DI into clinical practice.

## Teaching Styles in Direct Instruction for Children with ASD

- **[[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Direct Instruction\|Direct Instruction]] (DI) Approach**: DI is a structured teaching method designed to promote mastery of educational content through high rates of active group responding. It is led by a trained teacher who follows a scripted lesson plan to ensure consistency and quality across different implementers .
    
- **Core Teaching Procedures**: The DI method includes several key components:
    
    - **Orientation**: The teacher begins by orienting students to the exercise, describing the content to be taught .
        
    - **Presentation**: The teacher models the desired responses, providing clear examples for students to follow .
        
    - **Practice**: Students are given opportunities to practice the skills, either individually or in unison, to reinforce learning .
        
    - **Feedback**: Immediate feedback is provided, with praise for correct responses and error correction for incorrect ones .
        
    - **Independent Practice**: Students engage in independent practice to solidify their understanding and skills .
        
- **Scripted Lessons**: DI includes scripts that detail how instructors should present lessons, minimizing unnecessary talking and focusing on essential content delivery .
    
- **Systematic Prompt Fading**: The teaching style incorporates systematic prompt fading and discrimination checks to ensure students can generalize and maintain learned concepts .
    
- **Use of Multiple Exemplars**: DI employs a general case model of instruction, introducing new targets with multiple exemplars to prevent faulty stimulus control and promote generalization .
    
- **Grouping and Assessment**: Students are grouped based on performance, allowing instruction to progress at a reasonable pace. Placement tests guide lesson selection, and posttests inform necessary adjustments in instruction or group assignments .
    

This teaching style is characterized by its structured, systematic approach, focusing on clear, consistent instruction and active student engagement to facilitate learning for children with ASD.

## Limitations of Direct Instruction for Children with ASD

- **Conservative Assessment of Study Quality**: The review highlights that the dichotomous reporting of "met" or "not met" with respect to CEC standards may lead to an overly conservative assessment of study quality. This could potentially overlook nuanced aspects of the studies that partially meet the criteria .
    
- **Interpretation Variability**: There is a possibility that future reviewers might interpret the reported features differently, leading to varied conclusions regarding the quality of studies on DI. This variability in interpretation can affect the perceived effectiveness and applicability of DI for children with ASD .
    
- **Limited Scope of Included Programs**: The review only included "established" DI programs listed on the NIFDI website, which may limit the findings. Future reviews might consider a broader scope, incorporating studies that use instructional design steps and teaching procedures based on DI with new curricula or materials .
    
- **Lack of Familiarity Among Practitioners**: DI is not commonly included in behavior analytic services for learners with ASD, partly due to the unfamiliarity of behavior analysts with the research evaluating DI's efficacy. This lack of familiarity can hinder the adoption of DI in clinical practice .
    
- **Absence from Key Educational Resources**: DI is not listed on the Behavior Analysis Certification Board's 5th edition Task List, which influences the curriculum in master's level programs. Additionally, DI [[z Templates/Capstone Templates/z Templates/Articles\|Articles]] are not frequently published in mainstream behavior analytic journals, suggesting a need for more in-depth continuing education for behavior analysts .
    
- **Resource and Training Barriers**: The adoption of DI is challenged by the time and resources required to train implementers on new procedures. The lack of detailed information on treatment dosage, such as session duration and frequency, further complicates implementation .
    

These limitations highlight the challenges in adopting DI for children with ASD, emphasizing the need for broader research, increased practitioner education, and more comprehensive training resources.


## Key Components of Direct Instruction (DI)

- **Orientation**: The teacher begins by orienting the students to the exercise, describing the content that will be taught. This step sets the stage for learning by providing context and expectations for the lesson .
    
- **Presentation**: The teacher presents the content by modeling the desired responses. This involves demonstrating the correct way to approach the task or concept, providing a clear example for students to follow .
    
- **Practice**: Students are given opportunities to practice the new skills or concepts, either individually or in unison. This practice is crucial for reinforcing learning and allowing students to apply what they have learned in a controlled setting .
    
- **Feedback**: Immediate feedback is provided to students, with praise for correct responses and error correction for incorrect ones. This feedback loop helps reinforce correct behaviors and quickly addresses mistakes, facilitating effective learning .
    
- **Independent Practice**: After guided practice, students are given opportunities for independent practice. This step allows them to demonstrate their understanding and mastery of the content without direct teacher assistance, promoting autonomy and confidence in their skills .
    

These components are designed to work together to create a structured and effective learning environment, ensuring that students receive consistent and high-quality instruction throughout the learning process.

## Comparison of Direct Instruction (DI) to Other Methods

- **Effectiveness**: [[College/Capstone/Teaching Methods/Direct Instruction\|Direct Instruction]] (DI) is recognized as one of the most effective instructional approaches in the education literature. It has been implemented with thousands of students and is designed to promote mastery of educational content through high rates of active group responding led by a trained teacher.
    
- **Structure and Consistency**: DI is characterized by its highly structured and scripted lessons, which ensure consistent delivery across different implementers. This contrasts with other methods that may allow for more flexibility and variability in teaching styles and lesson delivery .
    
- **Feedback Mechanism**: DI emphasizes immediate feedback, providing praise for correct responses and error correction for incorrect ones. This immediate feedback loop is a distinctive feature that may not be as emphasized in other instructional methods, which might rely more on delayed feedback or self-assessment .
    
- **Principles of Learning**: DI is grounded in principles of learning such as systematic prompts, prompt fading, and discrimination checks. These principles are integrated into the teaching procedures and materials, which may not be as systematically applied in other instructional approaches .
    
- **Evidence-Based Practice**: DI has recently met criteria for consideration as an evidence-based practice for learners with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This recognition is important for encouraging its wider use in various contexts, particularly in behavior analytic services. Other methods may not have the same level of evidence-based recognition, especially in specific contexts like ASD .
    
- **Adoption in Practice**: Despite its effectiveness, DI is not commonly used in behavior analytic services for learners with ASD, possibly due to unfamiliarity among practitioners. This contrasts with other methods that might be more widely adopted due to their inclusion in standard curricula or more frequent coverage in mainstream journals .
