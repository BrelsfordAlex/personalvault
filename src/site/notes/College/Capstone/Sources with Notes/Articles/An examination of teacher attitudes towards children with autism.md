# Notes about the article
## Introduction

- Autism is a developmental disorder affecting 1 in 150 children.
    
- Conceptualizations of autism have evolved from emotional disorder to developmental disability.
    
- Significant progress has been made in understanding autism, though many questions remain.
    
- Professionals' attitudes towards autism influence intervention choices and success rates.
    
- Teachers' attitudes are crucial for the inclusion of autistic children in mainstream education.
    
- Negative attitudes from teachers can harm students' self-image and academic performance.
    
- Limited empirical research exists on teachers' attitudes towards autism specifically.
    
- Previous studies focused on integration and attitudes of nonprofessionals towards autism.
    
- Special education teachers may have more positive attitudes due to greater knowledge.
    
- Demographic factors and exposure to disabilities can affect attitudes towards autism.
    
- The study aims to examine teachers' attitudes, compare education types, and assess influencing variables.
    
- Understanding teachers' attitudes can inform training and professional development programs.
    

## Participants

- The sample included 127 teachers from a small Midwest town, 40% response rate.
    
- Majority of participants were female (88%) and general education teachers (83%).
    
- The town has five elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school.
    

## Instrument

- The Autism Attitude Scale for Teachers (AAST) was used to measure attitudes.
    
- AAST is a Likert-type scale with five response options.
    
- It consists of two seven-item forms with good reliability (alpha coefficients 0.85 and 0.78).
    
- Scores are calculated by summing individual item scores, with reverse scoring for negative items.
    
- The scale was updated to reflect 'person first language' in some items.
    
- Internal consistency estimates confirmed the reliability of the AAST.
    

## Procedure

- AAST was distributed anonymously to all 320 teachers in the town.
    
- Surveys were collected via direct mail or distribution at meetings.
    
- The overall return rate for the surveys was 40%.
    

## Correlations among the variables of the study

- Attitude was negatively correlated with age; younger teachers had more positive attitudes.
    
- Attitude was negatively correlated with school level; elementary teachers had the most positive attitudes.
    
- No significant relationship was found between years of teaching experience and attitude.
    

## Descriptive statistics

- Participants had a positive attitude towards children with autism (M = 4.06).
    
- Highest scores were for items related to inclusion in public school programs.
    
- Elementary teachers had more positive attitudes than middle school teachers.
    
- Teachers attending multiple autism workshops had higher attitude scores than those with less exposure.
    

## Demographic differences in teacher attitude towards autism

- Over 70% of participants had experience teaching children with special needs.
    
- 54% learned about special needs in college; 53% taught special classes.
    
- 42% had all types of exposure to children with disabilities.
    

## Two-way ANOVA

- A two-way ANOVA evaluated the influence of educational roles and gender on attitudes.
    
- Significant main effect found for educational roles; special education teachers had more positive attitudes.
    
- Gender also influenced attitudes, with female teachers showing more positivity.
    
- Another ANOVA examined educational roles and school levels; significant main effect for roles.
    

## Discussion and conclusion

- Majority of teachers had positive attitudes towards autism (M = 4.06).
    
- Attitudes influenced by gender, age, school level, and workshop experience.
    
- Female teachers had higher positive attitudes than male teachers.
    
- Younger teachers reported more positive attitudes than older teachers.
    
- Elementary teachers had more positive attitudes than middle and high school teachers.
    
- Workshop attendance correlated with higher positive attitudes.
    
- Exposure to children with autism likely contributed to favorable attitudes.
    
- The study indicates a positive shift in teachers' attitudes towards autism over time.
    
- Limitations include sample demographics and the age of the AAST instrument.
    
- Future research should explore additional factors influencing attitudes and include pre-service teachers.
    
- Collaboration among teachers, parents, and professionals is essential for effective inclusion.
    
- Promoting professional development can enhance teachers' attitudes towards children with autism.
    

## Impact of Workshop Attendance on Teacher Attitudes

- Teachers who attended autism workshops multiple times had significantly higher attitude scores (M = 4.49, SD = 0.44) compared to those who never attended workshops (M = 4.04, SD = 0.46) or attended only one workshop (M = 3.96, SD = 0.55) .
    
- There was no significant difference in attitude scores between teachers who had never attended a workshop and those who had attended only one .
    
- The study suggests that workshop attendance may contribute to more positive attitudes towards children with autism. However, it is also possible that teachers with inherently positive attitudes are more inclined to attend these workshops .
    
- A significant difference in attitudes was found between teachers who attended multiple workshops and those who did not, but the causal relationship between workshop attendance and attitude change remains unclear .
    
- Overall, workshop experience was identified as one of the factors influencing teachers' positive attitudes towards children with autism .
    

## Transformation in Understanding Autism Through Research

- **Shift in Conceptualization**: Research has led to a shift from early psychogenic theories, which viewed autism as an emotional disorder, to more recent conceptualizations of autism as a developmental disability. This change is largely due to advances in research that have provided a deeper understanding of the disorder .
    
- **Increased Knowledge and Understanding**: The increased knowledge about autism has significantly influenced professionals' beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes towards the disorder. This enhanced understanding has helped transform autism from an esoteric condition into a better-understood disorder .
    
- **Impact on Attitudes**: The robust research over the years has not only improved the understanding of autism but also positively influenced people's attitudes towards the disorder. This is evident in the positive shift in teachers' attitudes towards children with autism, which is a welcome development for families and educational practices .
    
- **Influence on Educational Practices**: The transformation in understanding has implications for educational practices, as teachers' attitudes, shaped by this research, can influence the types of interventions chosen for children with autism and the success of these interventions .
    
- **Ongoing Progress**: Although there are still many questions to be answered about autism, significant progress has been made, bringing us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the disorder .
