> " **It's not about what you want/what you see in the end. It's about what you perceive the end goal is at the moment of time, and that can change** "

*Remember, anything you do in life will never start as how you want it to look in the end. Everything you do will be ever-changing as you keep going. That does not mean you are doing it wrong. It just means you are learning. Your current end goal for it will change with time. All you have to do is ==never give up==*
# Welcome to My capstone
**By:** Alexandria Brelsford
**Capstone Year:** Spring 2025

**This site will hold:**
-  my class notes
- my sources and notes on them
- my personal [[College/Capstone/Capstone Writing/Due Dates\|Due Dates]]
- my project itself 
- resources for my project 

# **Some Things to note**
- This will be ongoing, the more I teach and discover teaching methods and create ways for ones I have listed to work, the more I will add to this. This is just what my knowledge is at this current moment in time. 
- Autism is always being researched, so there will be better research [[z Templates/Capstone Templates/z Templates/Articles\|Articles]] in the future for this topic
- **What is my topic?**
	- What are some teaching methods/strategies that can help students with autism in the classroom
- **What was my motivation?**
	- My motivation for this was a few things, seeing how my sister (who is now as of 2025 diagnosed with ADHD, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia) was passed along in the MA public school system. As well as my own experiences with school psychologists suggesting I may have autism and giving me a 504 plan for most of my early education (which I did not know till later on in life). 
	- I want to make it so that my classroom is better for my own sake and for any future students I have who may be either, just passed along without supports, or just not really told. I want to create a classroom that is dynamic and structured in a way that ==EVERY== Student can succeed. 
- **How is this project laid out?**
	- This project has many folders as you can see, I tried to make it organized in a way that not only I could understand but anyone to look at it could too. 
	- *The Folder labeled Capstone Writing* Has any writing I have done for this project
	- *Class Notes* are all class notes I have taken in my Capstone class
	- *PDFS Images and Stuff* is for images, templates, or anything I may need 
	- *Sources with Notes* This folder has a note page to every source I have found and taken notes on
	- *Teaching Methods* This folder has information about the teaching methods I have found in the sources and in my own teaching career
	- [[College/Capstone/About Autism In Schools\|About Autism In Schools]] Is a file that shows and links to how Autism could present in schools and some resources to help
	- ==Each page in the Teaching Methods folder has the same Layout==
- **What is this project made in?**
	- I made this project using a software called ==Obsidian== (https://help.obsidian.md/install)
