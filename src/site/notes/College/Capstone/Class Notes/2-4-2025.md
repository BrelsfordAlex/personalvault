I met with Clio today and this is what her recap email said 
- Based on your timeline, your task for next week is to get a set of sources and notes together for the area you're going to focus on first, which I imagine will be around autism.

-  She mentioned that it might be easier to focus on one disability rather than a little of each
- She even suggested that the website idea was a great idea
- She wants to help me stick to the [[College/Capstone/Capstone Writing/Due Dates\|Due Dates]] that I had set
