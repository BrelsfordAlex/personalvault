- Capstone/class is basically MCLA/Clio Specific
- Think outside of the Jargon and pragmatic thinking
- Meetings Schedule
	- Scheduled all group meetings 
	- more than not it will be individual/group meetings 
- Class is ==Pass/Fail== Style
- Clio will give intense feedback 
- A Written portion should be a justification on your project 
- Elevator Pitch
	- What are you working on and why 
	- you have 2-3 minutes to give your pitch to someone what are the key points 
	- My Project main points
		- Non Special education teaching methods and how they could help students with some learning disabilities and how these teaching methods work
		- Looking at main 3
			- Autism ADHD and Dyslexia
				- these are the ones that a gen-ed teacher will generally see in a class room
		- ==Why and how==
			- **Why:** Becoming a gen ed teacher that wants to have as many teaching styles under my belt as possible so i can help as many of my students as possible 
			- **How:** Looking at reports other teachers have done, research papers  and how students with the disabilities said they like to learn
		- **Questions from the class about my project**
			- Alex - How do autism, dyslexia and ADHD speak to larger collective issues that Gen Ed students can be incorporated into teaching that doesnâ€™t single out students with a more profound issue with these 3?
			- Alex, another good project. How would structure this project? Break it down into those specific needs?
			- How are you going to choose what methodologies to explore and how you are measuring success?
			- Alex - How will you quantify all the different ways of teaching things, especially across different subjects and topics?
- Have your own defined defintions clear in the beginning
- Universal Design for Learning
- Be clear about what  you don't want taken out of your work
