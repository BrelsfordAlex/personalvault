# How to tell you are in a triggered State
- Do you feel suddenly tired, like you need a nap?
- Do you feel “out of it,” like the world is moving but you’re not?
- Do you feel not real or disconnected from your body?
- Do you feel foggy or blank?
- Is it hard to focus or stay present?
# Crisis Plan

1. **Breathe** – 3 deep, slow breaths  
2. **Drink water** – cold if possible  
3. **Identify the trigger** – if safe, write it in [[Communication\|Communication]]  
4. **Use a grounding tool** – see [[Plans/Grounding Toolbox\|Grounding Toolbox]]  or [[What Helps\|What Helps]]
5. **Ask for help** if needed  
   - People you can talk to:  
     - [[Personal/People/Court(Partner)\|Court(Partner)]]  
     - [[Personal/People/Armore (Partner)\|Armore (Partner)]]  
     - [[Personal/People/Jen\|Jen]]  
     - [[Personal/People/Cam\|Cam]]
