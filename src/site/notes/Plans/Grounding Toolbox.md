# Grounding Tools

These are tools to help when you feel disconnected, overwhelmed, or foggy. You don’t have to do them all. Try what feels safe or possible.

---

## Sensory Grounding
- Hold a cold object (ice cube, chilled stone)
- Touch your feet to the floor and count to 10
- Listen to music with headphones (not too loud)
- Describe 5 things you can see right now

---

## Mental Grounding
- Breathe in for 4, out for 6
- Say out loud: “I am here. I am safe.”
- Stay in the moment  
  - Remember: **You cannot shut down if you want to lay down – that’s too many downs**

---

## Emotional Grounding
- Let yourself feel your emotions (you’re allowed)
- Talk to someone you trust
- Visit [[Plans/Crisis Plan\|Crisis Plan]] if you feel unsafe or overwhelmed

---

## Movement
- Go for a short walk — yes, this really helps
